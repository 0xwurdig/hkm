[thuds]

01:37.708 --> 01:40.250
[narrator in English] Pardon me,
this is no way to start a story.

01:40.333 --> 01:41.791
I'm Indian, after all,

01:41.875 --> 01:44.875
and it is an ancient
and venerated custom of my people

01:44.958 --> 01:47.500
to start a story
by praying to a higher power.

01:51.375 --> 01:55.291
So I, too, should start off
by kissing some God's foot, but which God?

01:56.416 --> 01:58.000
The Muslims have one.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.291
The Christians have three.

02:01.541 --> 02:03.833
And we Hindus have 36 million.

02:03.916 --> 02:06.375
Making a grand total of 36 million

02:06.458 --> 02:09.166
and four divine feet
for me to choose from.

02:10.208 --> 02:13.208
There are some
who think that none of these gods exist,

02:13.291 --> 02:16.333
but in my country,
it pays to play it both ways.

02:16.416 --> 02:21.250
The Indian entrepreneur has to be straight
and crooked, mocking and believing,

02:21.333 --> 02:24.625
sly and sincere, all at the same time.

02:26.291 --> 02:28.333
[reporter] Wen Jiabao,
Prime Minister of China,

02:28.416 --> 02:32.250
will arrive in India this month
to meet with leading Indian entrepreneurs.

02:32.333 --> 02:36.166
The Chinese Premier hopes to learn
about the growing Indian economy.

02:36.250 --> 02:40.541
The eyes of the world are watching
as these two economic superpowers meet.

02:41.208 --> 02:42.416
Jiabao is expected to…

02:42.500 --> 02:44.333
[narrator] Mr. Jiabao, Your Excellency,

02:44.416 --> 02:47.666
when I heard you were coming
to meet some Indian entrepreneurs,

02:47.750 --> 02:49.833
I just knew I had to email you.

02:55.166 --> 02:58.500
Our nation, though it has
no drinking water, electricity,

02:58.583 --> 03:00.875

03:00.958 --> 03:05.083

courtesy, or punctuality,

03:05.875 --> 03:07.666
does have entrepreneurs.

03:07.750 --> 03:09.666
[reporter] Prime Minister Jiabao
wants to learn

03:09.750 --> 03:12.166
about India's
booming outsourcing economy…

03:12.250 --> 03:15.250
[narrator] I've been following the rise
of your country for some time, sir.

03:15.333 --> 03:20.125
I know you Chinese are great lovers
of freedom and individual liberty.

03:20.791 --> 03:23.083
The British tried
to make you their servants,

03:23.166 --> 03:24.833
but you never let them.

03:25.541 --> 03:27.500
I admire that, Mr. Premier.

03:27.583 --> 03:30.416
You see, I was a servant once.

03:35.250 --> 03:38.083
Today, I am a celebrated entrepreneur
in Bangalore,

03:38.166 --> 03:40.125
the Silicon Valley of India.

03:40.208 --> 03:43.291
They say it's named
after a Silicon Valley in America,

03:43.375 --> 03:46.625
but I think we can agree
that America is so yesterday.

03:46.708 --> 03:49.750
India and China are so tomorrow.

03:52.791 --> 03:54.916
In the belief that the future of the world

03:55.000 --> 03:57.625
lies with the yellow man
and the brown man,

03:57.708 --> 04:00.833
now that our erstwhile master,
the white-skinned man,

04:00.916 --> 04:05.166
has wasted himself through buggery,
cell phone usage, and drug abuse,

04:05.250 --> 04:07.875
I offer to tell you, free of charge,

04:07.958 --> 04:12.166
the truth about India
by telling you the story of my life.

04:14.958 --> 04:19.333
These are the best-fed
and most important members of my family.

04:19.458 --> 04:22.166
After them, my sly, old Granny, Kusum.

04:23.250 --> 04:27.000
She had forced my brother,
Kishan, to work in the tea shop.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.833
And she took every rupee
from my father, a rickshaw puller.

04:33.250 --> 04:34.833
I come from the village of Laxmangarh,

04:35.500 --> 04:36.708
which is in the darkness.

04:37.791 --> 04:39.375
India is two countries in one,

04:40.416 --> 04:41.500
an India of light

04:43.875 --> 04:45.375
and an India of darkness.

04:47.291 --> 04:51.083
I think a rich man like you
knows which one I come from.

04:52.291 --> 04:56.333
To give you the basic facts about me,
there's no beating that poster,

04:56.416 --> 04:59.000
the one the police made of me
some years ago

04:59.083 --> 05:01.458
due to an act of entrepreneurship.

05:04.041 --> 05:07.125
Yes, the police are looking for me. Why?

05:07.916 --> 05:09.250
I'll get to that in time,

05:09.333 --> 05:14.541
but only if you promise not to judge me
until I've told you my glorious tale.

"The Lord Buddha
received enlightenment in this land."

05:37.375 --> 05:41.208
"We are grateful to God
that we are born in this land."

05:42.125 --> 05:43.083
Come here, boy.

05:48.500 --> 05:49.541
Who is this woman?

05:49.625 --> 05:51.208
The Great Socialist, sir.

05:51.291 --> 05:53.958
What is the Great Socialist's message
for children?

05:54.041 --> 05:57.333
Any poor boy in any forgotten village

05:57.875 --> 06:00.708
can grow up
to become prime minister of India.

06:00.791 --> 06:03.791

which is the rarest of animals

are called "shoulders."

07:15.291 --> 07:18.791
[Balram in English] The Stork.
He was the landlord who ruled our village

07:18.875 --> 07:21.916
and collected
a third of everything we earned.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.708
He fed so much on the village
that there was nothing left to feed on.

07:25.791 --> 07:26.625

07:26.708 --> 07:30.375

By the end of that year,

my father was sick with tuberculosis.

08:54.875 --> 08:57.583
No politician
had built a hospital in Laxmangarh,

08:57.666 --> 09:00.333
so we had to travel
two days to another village.

09:00.416 --> 09:02.250

I'll find a doctor.

11:43.708 --> 11:44.916
No.

It's because 99.9% of us

14:26.416 --> 14:29.416
I'm pinching! Granny, just think…

14:29.500 --> 14:31.875
You'll become
the richest woman in the village.

14:31.958 --> 14:35.541
This cane will become gold,
and when you swing it like this,

14:35.625 --> 14:37.666
the entire village
will line up to see you.

14:41.708 --> 14:44.583
[Kishan] Wait! Granny made your favorite!

14:44.666 --> 14:47.583
You eat your oily okra!
I'm gonna eat in Dhanbad!

14:47.666 --> 14:48.958
[Kishan shouts in Hindi]

14:51.625 --> 14:55.458
[men singing in Hindi]

15:17.875 --> 15:19.208
[vehicles honking]

15:20.333 --> 15:22.666
[Balram in English] And now,
I just had to learn to drive.

15:22.750 --> 15:24.208
[instructor speaking Hindi]

15:25.125 --> 15:26.583
[in English] Right. Right. Right.

15:26.666 --> 15:28.666
[in Hindi] Watch out, sister-fucker!

15:28.750 --> 15:31.125
You're from a caste of sweet makers.

15:31.208 --> 15:34.791
Only a boy from a warrior class
can tame a wild stallion.

15:34.875 --> 15:38.250
Muslims, Rajputs, Sikhs
have aggression in their blood.

15:38.791 --> 15:43.291
Why don't you stick to making sweets?

15:44.458 --> 15:46.666
[tires screeching]

15:47.750 --> 15:51.083
It's not enough to drive.
You've got to become a driver.

15:51.916 --> 15:54.625
Anyone tries to overtake you, do this…

15:54.708 --> 15:56.541
Out of the way, sister-fucker!

15:56.625 --> 15:57.708
[honking]

15:57.791 --> 16:00.708
-[Balram] Outta my way, fucker!
-[driver cursing in Hindi]

16:01.291 --> 16:02.708
The road is a jungle.

16:03.375 --> 16:07.041
A good driver
must roar to get ahead on it!

16:07.125 --> 16:08.500
-[engine revving]
-[honks]

16:12.375 --> 16:14.958
[Balram in English] It wasn't
so hard to find out where they lived.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.875
I just had to get through the door.

16:25.125 --> 16:26.666
-[in Hindi] Yeah?
-Namaste, sir.

16:26.750 --> 16:27.916
[in Hindi] What do you want?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.708
Any need of a driver, sir?

16:30.291 --> 16:32.750
I've got four years' experience.
My master recently died, so I--

16:32.833 --> 16:34.750
Get lost. We have a driver already.

16:34.833 --> 16:37.416
I see you have two cars, sir,
but do you have two drivers?

16:37.500 --> 16:40.458
What's wrong with you?
Get lost, motherfucker.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.458
Sir? This is your house?

16:42.541 --> 16:45.375
[in English] Namaste, sir. I'm from
your village, sir! From Laxmangarh.

16:45.458 --> 16:46.958
-[in Hindi] Laxmangarh?
-Yes, sir!

16:47.041 --> 16:49.791
The gods must be watching over us!

16:49.875 --> 16:52.833
[in English] I used to work at
the tea stall, sir, at the main junction!

16:52.916 --> 16:54.791
And I would bring tea
to your Ambassador car.

16:54.875 --> 16:57.250
-[speaks Hindi]
-Let the boy in.

16:57.333 --> 16:59.083
-But, sir--
-[The Stork] Let him in.

17:05.875 --> 17:07.541
I can't believe it's you, sir.

17:07.625 --> 17:10.333
How the crops died since you left.

17:10.416 --> 17:11.791
And we prayed that…

17:11.875 --> 17:14.750
[in English] …you should have more sons
to keep rule in the village, sir.

17:14.833 --> 17:15.916
[in Hindi] Get up.

17:17.875 --> 17:19.750
[in English] Do people still remember me?

17:19.833 --> 17:21.250
[in Hindi] Of course, sir.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.666
[in English] We all say
our father is gone, sir.

17:24.166 --> 17:27.291
The best and the most holy
of the landlords, like Gandhi-ji, sir.

17:27.375 --> 17:28.333
Like Gandhi?

17:28.416 --> 17:30.500
Ji, sir. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi-ji.

17:30.583 --> 17:31.500
Okay. Okay.

17:32.541 --> 17:33.541
What do you want?

17:33.625 --> 17:35.250
Sir, with your permission, sir,

17:35.333 --> 17:38.125
I want to be a driver for you…
or for your son.

17:38.916 --> 17:40.458
-Are you Muslim?
-[in Hindi] No, sir.

17:40.541 --> 17:43.791
[in English] I bathe regularly,
keep myself clean, sir, and I'm not lazy.

17:43.875 --> 17:45.875
-Hey, I'm Ashok.
-Hey, don't do that.

17:46.458 --> 17:48.166
You need a driver,
let's take him for a spin.

17:48.250 --> 17:49.833
-See how good he is.
-[in Hindi] Yes, sir.

17:51.208 --> 17:53.541
[in English] Just my luck, the Mongoose.

17:53.625 --> 17:56.083
-[The Stork in Hindi] He drives well.
-[in English] Yeah.

17:56.583 --> 17:58.958
-[in Hindi] What's your caste?
-Halwai, sir.

17:59.041 --> 18:00.666
Is that a high caste or low?

18:00.750 --> 18:02.166
[Balram in English] In the old days,

18:02.250 --> 18:04.250
when India was
the richest nation on Earth,

18:04.333 --> 18:06.416
there were 1,000 castes and destinies.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.625
These days, there are just two castes.

18:08.708 --> 18:12.458
Men with big bellies
and men with small bellies.

18:12.541 --> 18:15.958
And there are only two destinies,
eat or get eaten up.

18:16.041 --> 18:17.875
-[in Hindi] Low caste, sir.
-Ugh!

18:18.541 --> 18:21.916
-All our servants are high caste.
-[in English] Why does his caste matter?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.791
-[in Hindi] You drink?
-No, sir.

18:23.875 --> 18:26.500
-[in English] In my caste we never drink.
-So what do you do?

18:26.583 --> 18:27.458
[in Hindi] Steal?

18:28.875 --> 18:30.125
Halwai?

18:30.208 --> 18:31.791
-You're a sweet maker?
-Yes, sir.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.916
[in English] That's why
you're so sweet to us?

18:35.166 --> 18:37.500
-Do you cook?
-Certainly, sir. Very well.

18:37.583 --> 18:40.000
-Like what?
-Sir, all kinds of sweets, sir.

18:40.083 --> 18:43.833
Gulab jamun, rasgulla ho gaya,
ladoo, rasmalai, kaju barfi.

18:43.916 --> 18:45.416
[in Hindi] Whatever you like, sir.

18:45.500 --> 18:49.541
[in English] The driver can cook too.
Only in India. Can you start tomorrow?

18:49.625 --> 18:52.541
Not so fast, bhai.
We'll have to check on his family first.

18:52.625 --> 18:55.458
-[in Hindi] How much you want?
-I don't want any money, sir.

18:55.541 --> 18:59.083
[in English] You are like parents to me.
How can I ask my parents for money?

18:59.166 --> 19:00.416
Fifteen-hundred a month.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.291
[in Hindi] No, sir, that's too much.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.458
[in English] Give me
half of that, sir. It's enough.

19:04.541 --> 19:07.541
If we keep you
beyond two months, it will go to 2,000.

19:07.625 --> 19:09.000
And you only drive me.

19:09.083 --> 19:09.958
[in Hindi] Yes, sir.

19:11.625 --> 19:13.041
[honking]

19:13.125 --> 19:16.375
-[in English] Can you honk less?
-[in Hindi] Bro, you wanna climb in here?

19:16.458 --> 19:18.583
-Get moving!
-Watch how you drive!

19:18.666 --> 19:22.791
-[in English] Why'd you do that? Don't.
-[in Hindi] Get the rod? Get the rod.

19:22.875 --> 19:27.166
I know you're play-acting.
You haven't been hired yet, hick!

19:31.500 --> 19:34.291
[Balram in English] The Mongoose
must have called his man in Laxmangarh,

19:34.375 --> 19:37.041
because two days later
when they did hire me,

19:37.125 --> 19:39.125
they knew everything about my family.

19:40.875 --> 19:45.166
The pride and glory
of our nation, the Indian family.

19:47.166 --> 19:52.041
Every master has to know exactly where
their servant's family live at all times

19:52.125 --> 19:55.500
just in case a servant decides
to steal from his employer and run.

19:55.583 --> 19:56.791
If so…

19:58.208 --> 19:59.333
[gunshot]

20:01.333 --> 20:03.291
Fair enough. I would do the same.

20:06.625 --> 20:07.791
[man speaks Hindi]

20:09.916 --> 20:11.666
[Balram in English]
But it's what the masters do

20:11.750 --> 20:13.333
to their servants' families.

20:13.416 --> 20:14.541
[gun cocking]

20:18.541 --> 20:19.458
[gunshot]

20:20.333 --> 20:22.458
This is how the rooster coop works.

20:22.541 --> 20:26.250
This is how it traps so many millions
of men and women in India.

20:26.791 --> 20:30.750
So rest assured, the Stork
and his sons could count on my loyalty.

20:36.791 --> 20:38.000
[in Hindi] This is the room.

20:38.666 --> 20:39.875
This is my room?

20:39.958 --> 20:42.208
You'll share it with me.

20:42.291 --> 20:44.666
I'll find a mattress
from the store for you.

20:44.750 --> 20:46.291
No, there's no need for that.

20:46.375 --> 20:49.458
I'll be quite comfortable on the floor.
Nothing to worry about.

20:49.541 --> 20:51.708
-There's even a first class roof!
-[chuckles]

20:52.458 --> 20:55.250
Here. You're to wear this at all times.

20:55.916 --> 20:56.958
-[Balram] It's mine?
-Yes.

21:11.375 --> 21:13.541
-Hey, hero!
-Yes, sir?

21:14.583 --> 21:16.166
I hope you like carpets.

21:16.250 --> 21:19.208
When you're done cleaning those,
wash all the windows.

21:19.291 --> 21:20.500
Got it?

21:20.583 --> 21:22.083
But I'm the driver, sir.

21:22.166 --> 21:24.791
No. You're the "number two" driver.

21:30.541 --> 21:33.166
[speaking in Hindi]

21:43.166 --> 21:45.125
[Balram in English]
Is there any hatred on Earth

21:45.208 --> 21:48.416
like the hatred of the number-two servant
for the number one?

21:54.458 --> 21:57.791
While I cleaned,
he strolled about like a master.

21:59.166 --> 22:02.750
He had every Hindu God lined up
and was always praying,

22:02.833 --> 22:07.000
as if to accuse me of being a Naxal,
a communist, like you, sir.

22:07.875 --> 22:10.458
I would not let him out pray me.

22:10.541 --> 22:12.333
[both singing in Sanskrit]

22:23.666 --> 22:25.583
[in Hindi] Sir,
why is Ram Persad not eating?

22:25.666 --> 22:28.875
-And his mouth stinks these days.
-You keep your mouth shut.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.250
[continues speaking in Hindi]

22:32.916 --> 22:34.916
[Balram in English]
This man was hiding something,

22:35.000 --> 22:38.833
and a successful entrepreneur
always finds his competition's secrets.

22:42.750 --> 22:43.916
[Ashok and Pinky grunt]

22:44.291 --> 22:48.666
[Pinky] Good job. Good. Did you hear that?
Yeah, that was good, right?

22:50.041 --> 22:54.125
Hey, driver!
Hey, driver. Can you come here, please?

22:55.708 --> 22:57.875
[Pinky] All right,
I need you to lie down for this…

22:57.958 --> 22:59.166
Hey! Come in.

22:59.750 --> 23:01.625
I wanted to ask you some questions.

23:01.708 --> 23:04.250
Hey, could you
turn around for me for a second?

23:04.333 --> 23:05.708
-[Balram] Yes.
-[Pinky] No!

23:05.791 --> 23:08.958
[chuckles] That's not what I meant.
Just stand here.

23:09.041 --> 23:11.958
Um, I feel like your back's…

23:12.041 --> 23:13.708
[Balram] I'm ashamed to admit it now,

23:13.791 --> 23:16.583
but in that moment I thought
Mr. Ashok's wife, Pinky Madam,

23:16.666 --> 23:18.208
was one of "those women."

23:18.291 --> 23:20.666
[Pinky] Oh, I'm so sorry,
I didn't even introduce myself.

23:20.750 --> 23:23.250
Hi, I'm Pinky. Nice to meet you.

23:23.333 --> 23:25.541
Honey, honey, all right.
I need to talk to him.

23:25.625 --> 23:27.375
-All right. Okay.
-I need to talk.

23:27.458 --> 23:31.541
So, uh, driver. We're both…
I'm sorry. What's your name?

23:31.625 --> 23:33.208
-Sir, Balram, sir.
-[Ashok] Yeah, Balram.

23:33.291 --> 23:36.500
So, Balram,
do you know what the Internet is?

23:37.458 --> 23:40.291
No, sir, but I could drive
to the market right now, sir,

23:40.375 --> 23:41.500
and get as many as you want.

23:41.583 --> 23:43.708
No, it's okay. Thank you.

23:45.041 --> 23:46.291
Do you have Facebook?

23:47.083 --> 23:49.208
Yes, sir. Books.
I always loved books, sir.

23:49.291 --> 23:52.166
Yeah, I heard you can read.
Have you ever seen a computer?

23:52.250 --> 23:56.375
Yes, sir. Actually, we had many of them
in the village, with the goats.

23:56.458 --> 23:57.500
-[Ashok] Goats?
-Ji, sir.

23:57.583 --> 24:00.000
The goats
are pretty advanced to use computers.

24:00.083 --> 24:02.541
[Balram] I could tell from their faces
I had made a mistake.

24:02.625 --> 24:05.666
Pinky, you see. He's got two,
three years schooling in him.

24:05.750 --> 24:08.500
He can read and write,
but he doesn't get what he's read.

24:09.250 --> 24:10.125
He's half-baked.

24:10.208 --> 24:12.416
Okay, now you're being a jerk.
He's standing right there.

24:12.916 --> 24:14.791
-I'm not being a jerk.
-[Pinky] Come on, Ashok.

24:14.875 --> 24:16.166
You're missing the point, Pinky.

24:16.250 --> 24:19.208
Our driver represents
the biggest untapped market in India,

24:19.291 --> 24:23.166
waiting to surf the web, buy a cell phone,
rise up into middle class.

24:23.250 --> 24:24.833
Something I can help him do.

24:27.625 --> 24:29.125
You're the new India, Balram.

24:29.208 --> 24:30.666
I am the new India, sir.

24:33.291 --> 24:34.125
You can go.

24:40.708 --> 24:43.000
[Balram] I didn't like the way
he had spoken about me.

24:43.083 --> 24:46.166
"Half-baked." But he was right.

24:46.250 --> 24:47.791
When you come to India, sir,

24:47.875 --> 24:50.333
you'll meet hundreds
of millions of men like me.

24:50.416 --> 24:54.250
Open up our brown skulls
and look inside with a penlight.

24:54.333 --> 24:58.166
You'll find all these ideas,
half-formed, half-correct,

24:58.250 --> 25:02.458
all buggering one another,
and that is what we live and act on.

25:02.541 --> 25:04.166
[both speaking in Hindi]

25:10.208 --> 25:11.666
[The Stork] Ah!

25:11.750 --> 25:13.916
[in Hindi] Very good.
A little higher. Yeah, there.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.875
[in English] Papa, India's future is in
outsourcing with American companies.

25:17.958 --> 25:21.250
Our future is China. They're building
superhighways, they need coal,

25:21.333 --> 25:22.458
and we sell coal.

25:22.541 --> 25:25.666
But I really think we should diversify.
The IT sector is booming, the Internet--

25:25.750 --> 25:27.791
Internet? What is that?

25:28.833 --> 25:30.208
Coal is real. I can touch it.

25:30.291 --> 25:34.208
No, sir. I learned from Ashok Sir,
the Internet is as real as a spider's web,

25:34.291 --> 25:37.125
that it connects
all the human beings across--

25:37.208 --> 25:39.041
-[in Hindi] Know what that was for?
-Yes, sir.

25:39.125 --> 25:40.083
[in English] What for?

25:40.666 --> 25:43.166
-For the Internet, sir.
-Hey!

25:43.250 --> 25:46.125
You're pressing it too hard.
Papa is getting annoyed. Slow down.

25:46.208 --> 25:47.083
[The Stork] Hmm.

25:47.416 --> 25:48.666
[Ashok] Why do you hit the servants?

25:48.750 --> 25:49.916
In America, they can sue you for that.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.666
[The Stork] This is not America, son.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.625

[indistinct chatter]

38:47.708 --> 38:51.541
-[Mukesh] Thank you so much. Yes.
-Yeah, take care. Bye-bye. Yes.

38:51.625 --> 38:53.541
[Balram] Why was Mr. Ashok upset?

38:53.625 --> 38:57.333
If I had gone into the President's house,
I would be shouting,

38:57.416 --> 38:59.375
"Balram was here! Balram was here!"

39:00.583 --> 39:02.875
[Mukesh] You'll keep
visiting them while I'm gone,

39:02.958 --> 39:05.125
and don't let them push you
for more money.

39:06.625 --> 39:09.625
[Ashok] Look.
We're driving past Mahatma Gandhi

39:09.708 --> 39:12.208
after just having given
a bribe to the minister.

39:13.500 --> 39:16.041
The world's biggest democracy.
Fucking joke.

39:17.166 --> 39:20.416
-[Mukesh] You sound like your wife.
-[Ashok] Don't talk about her.

39:20.500 --> 39:23.125
[Mukesh] I hope your madam knows
that you're staying on in India.

39:23.916 --> 39:27.791
[train horn blaring]

39:27.875 --> 39:30.291
[indistinct announcement

39:30.375 --> 39:31.666
[in Hindi] Just a little bit.

39:32.541 --> 39:33.958
Mix it all up, please.

39:35.208 --> 39:38.791
[in English] A good servant
must know his masters from end to end,

39:38.875 --> 39:40.583
from lips to anus.

39:40.666 --> 39:41.583
Sir.

39:42.375 --> 39:44.833
[in Hindi] Here you are, sir.
I removed all the potatoes.

39:44.916 --> 39:47.250
[in English] And potatoes
made the Mongoose fart.

39:47.333 --> 39:49.708
-[in Hindi] Good memory, boy!
-[chuckles]

39:49.791 --> 39:52.166
[in English] Give my brother
a reading of the meter each day.

39:52.250 --> 39:53.208
[in Hindi] Yes, sir.

39:53.291 --> 39:55.791
[in English] So we know that
you're not driving without permission

39:55.875 --> 39:57.958

-[chuckling]
-[in Hindi] What're you laughing at?

40:01.375 --> 40:05.291
[in English] Police put cameras in all
the statues in Delhi. They're watching.

40:05.375 --> 40:06.833
-[in Hindi] Understand?
-Yes, sir.

40:06.916 --> 40:09.666
[in English] Air-conditioning and music
should be off when you're alone.

40:09.750 --> 40:12.791
-Nobody cares about your air conditioner.
-If you keep the air-conditioning on…

40:12.875 --> 40:14.916
[in Hindi] …he'll sit on your head
and fuck your ear.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.416
[in English] You'll miss your train.

40:18.458 --> 40:22.208
[Balram] Once the Mongoose left,
Mr. Ashok would be my only master.

40:22.791 --> 40:25.500
In Laxmangarh,
we would have called him the Lamb.

40:25.583 --> 40:26.500
[Ashok] See ya.

40:28.208 --> 40:30.166
["Feel Good Inc." playing on radio]

40:32.250 --> 40:33.958
[Ashok] Dude, I love this song.
Turn it up.

Come on.
Mukesh bhai isn't here, turn it up.

40:38.458 --> 40:42.000
[Balram] My master's fruit-flavored
perfume rushed into my nostrils.

40:42.083 --> 40:43.291
You like this?

40:44.791 --> 40:45.750
[in Hindi] Yes, sir.

40:47.250 --> 40:49.791
[in English] And don't tell anyone
about this, not even Pinky.

40:49.875 --> 40:50.750
[in Hindi] No, no!

40:50.833 --> 40:53.583
-[in English] I promised her I would stop.
-[in Hindi] No, sir.

40:53.666 --> 40:56.500
[in English] Everything between
servant and master is always secret.

40:56.583 --> 40:59.208
I'm not your master.
Don't say things like that.

40:59.291 --> 41:00.458
[agrees in Hindi]

41:00.541 --> 41:02.166
[in English] And stop calling me "sir."

41:02.875 --> 41:05.500
-My name's Ashok. You can call me Ashok.
-Ashok.

41:05.583 --> 41:07.041
Yes, Ashok.

41:07.125 --> 41:09.625
I know it's not the best name,
but gotta live with it.

41:09.708 --> 41:12.500
-It is a really good name, sir.
-Really?

41:12.583 --> 41:14.958
-You like it? You keep it then.

41:28.291 --> 41:29.916

This has revenge, rape, murder, sex.
It's got everything.

42:24.708 --> 42:26.583
You can really enjoy yourself.

42:51.333 --> 42:52.791
Want me to put in a good word?

42:52.875 --> 42:58.125
I noticed how ladies in the city

43:47.750 --> 43:48.833
There's one there.

44:41.750 --> 44:43.000
That's so pretty.

You touched your finger to your eye?

Did we pass something holy?

45:06.125 --> 45:06.958
Yes, sir.

Actually, we just passed a sacred tree,
so I was offering my respects.

45:11.416 --> 45:12.666
Where? Which one?

45:12.750 --> 45:15.083
-Over there, madam.

-This entire area is very holy.
-[Ashok] Wow.

-Yeah, right.

Did we pass another one?

Yes, sir. You see that path over there?

45:33.125 --> 45:33.958
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

Sir, they say
Lord Buddha walked on that path

-Yes.

Pardon me,
but I think you should do the same.

-No.

-No!

and temple we passed.

46:52.125 --> 46:53.583
How's it going, brother?

46:54.333 --> 46:56.083
Now he remembers his family.

46:56.166 --> 46:58.625
You haven't sent money home
since you went to Delhi.

46:58.708 --> 47:02.250
Forgive me, brother. I'm here now.

47:02.333 --> 47:04.333

47:06.625 --> 47:09.583
My grandson is a very big man!

47:10.208 --> 47:15.083
But he forces his Granny
to do all his work for him.

47:15.166 --> 47:19.541
This is the fate
of an old woman in this world.

47:24.750 --> 47:28.333
[Balram in English] I wanted to bring him
to Delhi and save him from all this.

47:31.250 --> 47:33.791
I made it myself.

47:34.333 --> 47:37.000
You haven't had any like it in ages.

47:38.333 --> 47:39.875
Ashok Sir is a vegetarian.

47:41.166 --> 47:44.291
America made him completely lose his mind.

47:44.375 --> 47:46.625
[Balram] I'm thinking of doing the same.

47:46.708 --> 47:48.083
What? Are you a Brahmin?

47:48.166 --> 47:50.416
Eat. You've gotten so thin.

47:50.500 --> 47:53.833
A body should be filled out for marriage.

47:55.250 --> 47:57.333
-Whose marriage?
-Yours!

47:57.416 --> 47:59.583
We found a girl for you.

47:59.666 --> 48:03.500
You'll be married by the end of the year.

48:08.208 --> 48:11.125
I need time. I'm not ready to get married.

48:11.208 --> 48:12.500
[Kusum] Not ready?

48:13.083 --> 48:14.625
Just eat the chicken.

48:14.708 --> 48:16.375
I don't want to get married.

48:16.458 --> 48:22.583
Stop thinking of yourself
and start thinking of the family.

48:24.541 --> 48:25.458
Eat.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.083
Are you going to force me?
I don't want to get married!

What happened?

48:43.375 --> 48:45.583
-You must keep sending money.
-I won't send it.

48:45.666 --> 48:47.041
That's the family's money!

48:47.958 --> 48:51.541
She's sucked the blood
out of you and left you a shell.

48:51.625 --> 48:53.875
And she'll leave you to die, like Dad.

49:13.625 --> 49:16.375
[Ashok in English] Why don't I eat meat?
Why does Pinky wear pants?

49:16.458 --> 49:18.458
Why don't we have kids? They won't stop.

49:18.541 --> 49:20.625
[Balram] I think
we should not go back there, sir.

49:21.125 --> 49:21.958
[Ashok] Maybe.

49:22.041 --> 49:23.625
[distant mooing]

49:24.166 --> 49:27.041
You know, one in every three buildings
in India is built in Bangalore.

49:27.583 --> 49:28.458
You know why?

49:28.958 --> 49:31.625
-Outsourcing with the US.
-[Balram] Diversifying, sir?

49:33.000 --> 49:35.625
[Ashok] Yeah, right. Not bad, Balram.

49:35.708 --> 49:36.666
[Balram chuckles]

49:37.958 --> 49:39.916
I'm thinking to offer financial services.

49:40.833 --> 49:42.791
There's so many Wall Street firms I know.

49:44.291 --> 49:46.458
I can drive you
to Bangalore right now, sir.

49:47.333 --> 49:48.666
-Right now?
-Yes, sir.

49:49.583 --> 49:52.250
-It's on the opposite side of the country.
-It's okay, sir.

49:52.333 --> 49:54.416
I don't need sleep. I can drive all night.

49:55.166 --> 49:56.125
No, thank you.

49:56.833 --> 50:00.208
I got to make a business plan first.
Do it the right way.

50:00.750 --> 50:02.208
You will, sir. You will.

50:02.833 --> 50:04.250
Yes. I will.

50:05.125 --> 50:06.541
-[Pinky] Ashoky!
-Yeah?

50:07.833 --> 50:10.583
[Balram] If only Mr. Ashok
was a real entrepreneur,

50:10.666 --> 50:13.333
if only we had left for Bangalore
that very day,

50:14.708 --> 50:16.583
then things would've
turned out differently for us.

50:20.416 --> 50:23.541
Rich men are born
with opportunities they can waste.

50:25.416 --> 50:27.416
[children chattering]

50:28.333 --> 50:29.250
But a poor man?

50:34.166 --> 50:37.416
Feels like, "Are we gonna go back home,
or does he want to stay here?"

50:37.500 --> 50:39.291
You need to talk. Put your foot down.

50:39.375 --> 50:41.833
Yeah, but he's not had
that conversation with me.

50:41.916 --> 50:44.583
I think he's being vague
because he hasn't figured it out--

50:44.666 --> 50:46.916
Balram! What are you doing?

50:47.000 --> 50:49.291
-Your ginger teas, madam?
-With your hand.

1:04:11.375 --> 1:04:13.250
[doorbell rings]

1:04:15.958 --> 1:04:17.375
Namaste, sir.

1:04:17.458 --> 1:04:20.041

Come, come.

1:04:25.250 --> 1:04:27.083
-[Balram] Greetings, sir!
-Come in.

1:04:27.833 --> 1:04:28.708
Have a seat.

1:04:28.791 --> 1:04:29.625
[in English] Sit up.

1:04:29.708 --> 1:04:31.750
[in Hindi] On the sofa.
Make yourself comfortable.

1:04:31.833 --> 1:04:33.916
-[in English] You are family now.
-[in Hindi] Nahi, sir.

1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:34.833
[chuckling]

1:04:35.833 --> 1:04:36.791
[speaks Hindi]

1:04:37.500 --> 1:04:38.333
Come, sit.

1:04:39.708 --> 1:04:41.541
-All good?
-Great, sir.

1:04:42.958 --> 1:04:45.791
[in English] Have you spoken with anyone
about what happened last night?

1:04:45.875 --> 1:04:48.416
[in Hindi] No, sir.
I washed the car and went to bed.

1:04:48.500 --> 1:04:49.541
-Good.
-Yes, sir.

1:04:49.625 --> 1:04:52.208
[in English] It's important
that you not say a word to anyone.

1:04:52.291 --> 1:04:53.458
[in Hindi] Yes, sir.

1:04:54.083 --> 1:04:56.375
-Would you like some paan?
-No, sir, I quit paan.

1:04:56.458 --> 1:04:58.041
Come on! You still eat paan, I know it!

1:04:58.125 --> 1:05:00.791
No, really, sir!
Ashok Sir, tell them. [chuckling]

1:05:00.875 --> 1:05:02.625
-I know you eat paan.
-Come on, sir.

1:05:02.708 --> 1:05:03.875
[in English] Open it.

1:05:09.583 --> 1:05:11.416
-[in Hindi] Is it all right?
-It's very good!

1:05:11.500 --> 1:05:13.083
[lawyer in English]
The judge is taken care of.

1:05:13.166 --> 1:05:16.041
If your man does as he's supposed to,
you'll have nothing to worry about.

1:05:16.125 --> 1:05:17.916
My man will do what he's to do.

1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:19.250
-[in Hindi] Right, Balram?
-Yes, sir.

1:05:19.916 --> 1:05:22.166
-[in English] Can you read?
-Of course he can read.

1:05:23.833 --> 1:05:25.541
-Read it to us.
-Ji, sir.

1:05:26.375 --> 1:05:27.875
[in Hindi] I got some paan on it.

1:05:30.625 --> 1:05:32.458
[in English] "To whomsoever
it may concern…"

1:05:33.125 --> 1:05:34.791
"I, Balram Halwai,

1:05:34.875 --> 1:05:37.541
do make the following statement
of my own free will."

1:05:38.250 --> 1:05:41.875
"On the night of November 3rd this year,
I drove the car…

1:05:43.041 --> 1:05:48.333
that hit an unidentified person,
or persons, or objects."

1:05:51.083 --> 1:05:52.250
[in Hindi] I don't understand, sir.

1:05:52.333 --> 1:05:55.250
[Mukesh] We'll explain it
to you afterwards. Keep reading.

1:05:58.416 --> 1:06:02.958
[in English] "That I panicked and refused
my obligations to the injured party…

1:06:04.083 --> 1:06:05.625
and fled the scene."

1:06:05.708 --> 1:06:10.333
"That I was alone
in the car and alone responsible."

1:06:12.333 --> 1:06:14.166
[Mukesh] We've already told your family.

1:06:15.500 --> 1:06:17.875
Your Granny, uh… What's her name?

1:06:18.583 --> 1:06:19.416
Balram?

1:06:20.708 --> 1:06:21.750
-Hey, Balram?
-Ji, sir?

1:06:21.833 --> 1:06:23.291
[Mukesh] What's her name? Uh…

1:06:23.375 --> 1:06:25.166
-Kusum, sir.
-[Mukesh] Kusum-ji.

1:06:25.250 --> 1:06:28.750
I drove down to Laxmangarh,
explained her everything.

1:06:28.833 --> 1:06:29.958
I met your brother.

1:06:30.875 --> 1:06:32.333
Your entire family was there.

1:06:33.125 --> 1:06:34.875
She's so proud of you for this,

1:06:35.833 --> 1:06:38.375
and she agreed
to be a witness to your confession.

1:06:40.083 --> 1:06:42.416
See? This is the thumb impression here.

1:06:44.833 --> 1:06:46.166
Just sign above that.

1:06:46.916 --> 1:06:48.708
[lawyer] If he doesn't know to write,
he can press his thumb.

1:06:48.791 --> 1:06:51.166
He knows to write.
Stop treating him like an idiot!

1:06:51.250 --> 1:06:52.125
Keep quiet, Ashok.

1:06:52.208 --> 1:06:55.333
-We shouldn't do this. It's not right.
-[Mukesh] Balram, sign.

1:06:55.416 --> 1:06:58.125
Then you and Pinky go to the police
and tell them what happened.

1:06:58.916 --> 1:07:02.125
If you understand law, then handle this.
Otherwise, just shut up!

1:07:05.250 --> 1:07:06.291
[mutters softly]

1:07:14.791 --> 1:07:16.666
Balram, just go on.

1:07:20.875 --> 1:07:22.083
Balram, go on.

1:07:22.708 --> 1:07:25.875
[in Hindi] Go ahead and sign it, brother.
Right here.

1:07:38.166 --> 1:07:40.041
Aren't you my brother? My younger brother?

1:07:40.125 --> 1:07:40.958
Yes, sir.

1:07:41.041 --> 1:07:42.750
[Mukesh] We eat and hang out together.

1:07:42.833 --> 1:07:45.791
Dad's here, I'm here.
Brother Ashok is right there.

1:07:46.750 --> 1:07:49.541
-Is there anything to worry about?
-No, sir.

1:07:49.666 --> 1:07:53.166
[Mukesh laughing] Huh?

1:07:55.416 --> 1:07:56.250
Go on.

1:07:56.333 --> 1:07:58.458
[in English]
Just go and wait outside. We'll call you.

1:08:00.250 --> 1:08:01.208
[speaks Hindi]

1:08:01.291 --> 1:08:04.208
-[Mukesh in Hindi] All right? Go on.
-Go on.

1:08:05.375 --> 1:08:06.291
All right, sir.

1:08:11.416 --> 1:08:12.666
No need for that.

1:08:46.750 --> 1:08:47.583
[elevator dings]

1:08:47.666 --> 1:08:48.958
[elevator door opening]

1:10:04.333 --> 1:10:08.000
[in English] To think of this again
makes me so angry

1:10:08.083 --> 1:10:11.916
that I might go out and cut the throat
of some rich man right now.

1:10:14.458 --> 1:10:15.833
[exhales]

1:10:18.416 --> 1:10:20.875
Not once did I think I had options.

1:10:22.625 --> 1:10:27.375
Not once did I think
I'll tell the judge the truth or run away.

1:10:30.166 --> 1:10:31.708
[in Hindi] Give me Moonlight Whiskey.

1:10:32.583 --> 1:10:34.541
[Balram in English]
I was trapped in the rooster coop,

1:10:34.625 --> 1:10:37.833
and don't believe for a second
there's a million-rupee game show

1:10:37.916 --> 1:10:39.750
you can win to get out of it.

1:10:39.833 --> 1:10:42.041
[indistinct chatter]

1:10:46.416 --> 1:10:48.458

1:10:52.750 --> 1:10:54.208
[indistinct chatter]

1:10:56.583 --> 1:10:59.541
For hundreds
of millions of people like me,

1:10:59.625 --> 1:11:01.833
there is only one way to break free.

1:11:02.583 --> 1:11:05.458
I would have to accept
what this man's family would do…

1:11:06.375 --> 1:11:08.833
not just to me but to my family.

1:11:14.500 --> 1:11:16.666
And that takes no normal human being

1:11:16.750 --> 1:11:19.000
but a freak, a pervert of nature.

1:11:20.541 --> 1:11:23.541
It would, in fact, take a white tiger.

1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:28.708
[telephone ringing]

1:11:33.750 --> 1:11:34.791
[in Hindi] Here you are!

1:11:35.708 --> 1:11:37.958
Your boss
has been calling like crazy for you.

1:11:38.708 --> 1:11:40.333
He came down here last night too.

1:11:42.750 --> 1:11:43.583
Are you sick?

1:11:44.583 --> 1:11:45.416
Typhoid?

1:11:46.125 --> 1:11:48.166
Dengue? Malaria?

1:11:50.416 --> 1:11:53.416
You seem to be in some big trouble.

1:11:54.750 --> 1:11:56.708
[indistinct commentary over TV]

1:12:03.833 --> 1:12:05.250
[The Stork] Oy, jackass dick.

1:12:05.333 --> 1:12:07.750
How many times do I have to call for you?

1:12:07.833 --> 1:12:11.041
What're you staring at?
Get the bottle of oil, useless fucker.

1:12:17.333 --> 1:12:19.958
-[The Stork grunts]
-[commentary continues on TV]

are taking shit out there.

1:12:34.541 --> 1:12:35.500
[The Stork] You're back?

1:12:36.083 --> 1:12:37.375
Come, sit down.

1:12:37.458 --> 1:12:40.708
-[in English] Who's winning?
-[The Stork in Hindi] See for yourself.

1:12:40.791 --> 1:12:42.791
-[Mukesh in English] We're losing.
-Balram.

1:12:43.458 --> 1:12:44.291
Yeah.

1:12:45.041 --> 1:12:46.208
[clears throat] Hey, Balram?

1:12:47.208 --> 1:12:48.333
Have they told you?

1:12:50.500 --> 1:12:52.208
You haven't told him?

1:12:52.291 --> 1:12:53.750
[Mukesh] Hmm? [clicks tongue]

1:12:55.333 --> 1:12:56.291
I got it.

1:12:58.041 --> 1:12:58.875
Balram.

1:12:59.916 --> 1:13:00.833
Um…

1:13:01.625 --> 1:13:02.541
[Pinky sighs]

1:13:03.541 --> 1:13:05.750
They have a contact at the police.

1:13:08.166 --> 1:13:13.750
No one reported seeing what I did,
so they don't need you anymore.

1:13:23.291 --> 1:13:24.291
[Balram sniffles]

1:13:25.750 --> 1:13:28.708
[The Stork in Hindi] There, there.
Enough of your drama. Massage my feet!

1:13:29.458 --> 1:13:32.291
-[in English] Why would you kick him?
-[The Stork in Hindi] He's fucking lazy!

1:13:32.375 --> 1:13:34.083
[in English]
Why would you hit him like that?

1:13:34.166 --> 1:13:37.083
-[Ashok] Hey, Pinky, calm down.
-How can you do that? Like he doesn't--

1:13:37.166 --> 1:13:39.625
[Pinky] Don't tell me to calm down.
It's like you don't care.

1:13:39.708 --> 1:13:42.125
-Do you like it?
-[Ashok] Pinky, let go of him!

1:13:42.208 --> 1:13:44.583
And nobody else matters
after what he does?

1:13:44.666 --> 1:13:46.875
-[Pinky] You! Get away from me.
-[Ashok] It's all good now.

1:13:46.958 --> 1:13:48.125
[Pinky] This is good?

1:13:48.208 --> 1:13:49.500
And this shit?

1:13:50.333 --> 1:13:51.166
I'm done.

1:13:52.750 --> 1:13:54.166
I'm done with this.

1:13:54.250 --> 1:13:57.166
[Mukesh in Hindi] She's looking for
the victim's family, to compensate them.

1:13:57.250 --> 1:13:59.250
-What are we, murderers?
-[Ashok] She won't do that.

1:13:59.333 --> 1:14:01.125
[Mukesh] Dude, shut up.

1:14:01.208 --> 1:14:03.666

[in Hindi] Hey, brother.
Can you give me something to eat?

1:15:31.041 --> 1:15:34.000
-[spits] Move along.
-I haven't eaten anything in days.

1:15:34.083 --> 1:15:35.958
I don't have anything, move along.

1:15:36.041 --> 1:15:38.833
You must have a rupee,
please give it to me, brother.

1:15:38.916 --> 1:15:40.666
-Move along.
-Where should I go?

1:15:40.750 --> 1:15:43.291
I told you to move along!
Does your head not work?

1:15:43.375 --> 1:15:46.750
You want this? Should I take
my clothes off and give them to you?

1:15:46.833 --> 1:15:48.083
You want me to get naked?

1:15:48.166 --> 1:15:51.125
-Maybe something to eat…
-This woman is driving me insane!

1:15:51.208 --> 1:15:53.125
Give me something to eat…

1:15:53.208 --> 1:15:56.208
I've earned 36 rupees in six months.
Shall I give it all to you?

1:15:56.291 --> 1:15:57.791
Then what should I eat?

1:15:57.875 --> 1:16:00.083
Give me some food, my child.

1:16:00.166 --> 1:16:01.833
This woman has gone crazy!

1:16:01.916 --> 1:16:04.791
Get her out of here. She's lost her mind.

1:16:05.916 --> 1:16:07.750
Arrest her! You are the police!

1:16:22.666 --> 1:16:23.666
[Pinky in English] Balram.

1:16:28.291 --> 1:16:29.666
I need you to drive me.

1:16:52.791 --> 1:16:54.916
[Pinky] You were looking
for the key for years,

1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:57.750
but the door was always open.

1:17:00.333 --> 1:17:02.041

-Sir--

-Why didn't you tell me?
-Sir, I did what she asked me to.

1:18:11.416 --> 1:18:13.208
Why would you drop her behind my back?

-Why would you do that?
-Sir, you can't blame me.

1:18:16.166 --> 1:18:18.458
Who should I blame then? You're my driver!

1:19:49.583 --> 1:19:52.500
Sir, it is not good
to starve yourself like this.

1:19:53.833 --> 1:19:54.750
Sir, should I--

1:19:54.833 --> 1:19:57.125
The whole fucking thing was her fault.

1:19:58.875 --> 1:20:00.291
Fucking bitch.

1:20:01.291 --> 1:20:03.000
Should I call for pizza, sir?

1:20:03.083 --> 1:20:03.916

1:20:18.833 --> 1:20:20.041
Feeling better, sir?

1:20:22.291 --> 1:20:24.000
You must believe in God, sir.

1:20:25.666 --> 1:20:29.583
My Granny says if you believe in God,
then good things will happen.

1:20:32.833 --> 1:20:34.708
Why are you so kind to me, Balram?

1:20:37.291 --> 1:20:38.458
It is my duty, sir.

1:20:45.125 --> 1:20:47.250
Sir, I made some nimbu pani for you.

1:20:47.958 --> 1:20:49.958
Have this, you'll feel ekdum fresh, sir.

1:20:56.083 --> 1:20:56.916
Ashok Sir?

1:20:59.583 --> 1:21:00.458
Ashok Sir?

1:21:03.541 --> 1:21:04.583
[whispering] Ashok Sir?

1:21:18.583 --> 1:21:21.583
Do we loathe our masters
behind a facade of love,

1:21:22.375 --> 1:21:25.291
or do we love them
behind a facade of loathing?

1:21:47.375 --> 1:21:49.333
-Where's Pinky?
-[shushes]

1:21:50.375 --> 1:21:52.041

1:21:53.500 --> 1:21:55.166
Don't leave, Balram, okay?

1:21:56.166 --> 1:21:57.375
I'm right here, sir.

1:22:09.125 --> 1:22:10.041
[sniffing]

1:22:32.125 --> 1:22:34.333

"Why are you so kind to me, Balram?"

1:22:50.375 --> 1:22:51.458
[exhales]

1:23:02.916 --> 1:23:08.166
[Balram] With Pinky Madam gone, I knew
it was my duty to be like a wife to him.

1:23:08.250 --> 1:23:11.375
I didn't let him drink,
and I lifted his spirits.

1:23:13.291 --> 1:23:16.041
[Balram in Hindi] Once you have the
food here, sir, you'll never forget it.

1:23:20.333 --> 1:23:21.500
[in English] This is amazing.

-[speaks Hindi]

1:23:24.833 --> 1:23:27.000

I'll only eat your kind of food.

1:23:27.083 --> 1:23:27.916
[laughing]

1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:30.041
[Balram] And I only want
to eat your kind of food.

1:23:30.125 --> 1:23:32.166
[Ashok] You know
the real India better than me.

1:23:32.250 --> 1:23:33.333
You know, my mom,

1:23:34.250 --> 1:23:37.833
she was the one who encouraged me
to go to America and study.

1:23:40.083 --> 1:23:41.458
Pinky really loved her.

1:23:50.125 --> 1:23:53.041
You know, sir, Pinky Madam told me
that you are a great man

1:23:53.125 --> 1:23:55.458
who is going to do
great things in India, sir.

1:23:56.625 --> 1:23:59.541
-When did she say that?
-The morning she left.

1:24:00.125 --> 1:24:03.083
She was crying the entire way
to the airport, sir. [clicks tongue]

1:24:04.500 --> 1:24:07.375
And she told me that you will not
let Mukesh Sir tell you what to do.

1:24:08.791 --> 1:24:10.583
And that she believes in you.

1:24:13.166 --> 1:24:14.583
[bell chiming]

1:24:28.541 --> 1:24:30.291
She'll come back to you, sir.

1:24:31.500 --> 1:24:32.333
Yeah.

1:24:33.166 --> 1:24:35.708
She's coming back. I can feel it.

1:24:36.291 --> 1:24:37.666
I can feel it, too, sir.

1:24:40.375 --> 1:24:41.458
[coins clattering]

1:25:10.125 --> 1:25:11.291
How are you?

1:25:12.666 --> 1:25:13.708
[in Hindi] Go get the car.

1:25:14.500 --> 1:25:15.666
[in English] Get the car.

1:25:19.791 --> 1:25:20.625
Divorce?

1:25:22.083 --> 1:25:22.916
She said that?

1:25:23.708 --> 1:25:26.625
-Don't worry. I'm handling it.
-[Ashok] You're probably happy she's gone.

1:25:26.708 --> 1:25:29.541
[Mukesh] That's not true.
I want your happiness, bhai.

1:25:29.625 --> 1:25:32.791
-I'm gonna go there and talk to her.
-Wait, stop. Ashok.

1:25:32.875 --> 1:25:36.375
-No, I need to talk to her--
-You can't call her like this.

1:25:37.041 --> 1:25:39.541
Stop pleading like this. You'll regret it.

1:25:41.458 --> 1:25:44.333
The only thing I regret
is letting her drive that night.

1:25:45.166 --> 1:25:47.666
-[Mukesh] It's not your fault. You know.
-It is my fault.

1:25:47.750 --> 1:25:50.041
[Mukesh] Listen, I can stay
with you as long as you like.

1:25:50.500 --> 1:25:54.083
Let me order that pizza which you like,
that macaroni one. [chuckles]

1:25:55.166 --> 1:25:56.958
[Ashok] I'm sorry, bhai. Without you, I'd…

1:25:59.333 --> 1:26:01.416
[in Hindi]
Look what I brought for you, sir.

1:26:01.500 --> 1:26:03.208
Nice and hot okra.

1:26:03.291 --> 1:26:06.541
-[in English] I don't want food right now.
-Just like we had the other night, sir.

1:26:07.166 --> 1:26:09.125
[in Hindi] Nice and crispy, check it out.

1:26:09.208 --> 1:26:10.416
[in English] I don't give a shit.

1:26:11.250 --> 1:26:13.166
[in Hindi]
Don't say that. Have a little bit.

1:26:13.250 --> 1:26:14.500
[in English] I'm not hungry!

1:26:16.458 --> 1:26:17.958
Get lost, please.

1:26:18.916 --> 1:26:20.958
[in Hindi] He doesn't feel like it.
Why're you up in his ass?

1:26:21.041 --> 1:26:22.166
Get rid of it, sister-fucker!

1:26:22.250 --> 1:26:24.333
[Ashok in English] Can you just
leave me alone for a second?

1:26:24.833 --> 1:26:27.666
[in Hindi] Until Ashok Sir calls you,
don't hover like a fly!

1:26:28.291 --> 1:26:29.166
Yes, sir.

1:26:44.541 --> 1:26:48.041
[Balram in English] The desire to be
a servant had been bred into me,

1:26:48.125 --> 1:26:51.458
poured into my blood,
hammered into my skull.

1:26:53.500 --> 1:26:56.583
Ninety-three hundred rupees,
a strange sum,

1:26:57.083 --> 1:26:59.958
almost three months my salary
but not quite.

1:27:01.916 --> 1:27:05.000
Maybe she started with 10,000
and then deducted 700?

1:27:05.083 --> 1:27:06.208
No, no, no.

1:27:06.291 --> 1:27:08.291
That is not how rich people think.

1:27:08.375 --> 1:27:11.500
[chuckling] Have you not
learned anything, you idiot?

1:27:11.583 --> 1:27:15.333
If she thought she owed you 10,000,
she truly owed you ten times more.

1:27:15.416 --> 1:27:18.833
Ten times more. No! A hundred times more.
A hundred times more.

1:27:18.916 --> 1:27:20.041
[panting]

1:27:22.250 --> 1:27:26.666
They made me sign that confession,
and I asked for nothing in return.

1:27:27.916 --> 1:27:30.625
Why did I not ask?
I didn't even think to ask.

1:27:32.125 --> 1:27:33.625
I didn't even think to ask.

1:27:38.375 --> 1:27:42.000
[in Hindi] Have you ever thought about
what happens to you in the future?

1:27:42.958 --> 1:27:43.791
Eyes.

1:27:44.291 --> 1:27:47.083
As long as you have eyes, you'll work.

1:27:47.166 --> 1:27:50.541
But when you turn 50-55,
they'll kick your ass out.

1:27:51.333 --> 1:27:52.291
And then?

1:27:53.083 --> 1:27:55.916
If you've saved some money,
you can buy a little shack.

1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:59.708
But if you're clever like me
and earn extra money, then maybe more.

1:28:00.416 --> 1:28:02.416
That's the best case scenario.

1:28:02.500 --> 1:28:05.583
Imagine your boss
kicks you out without any reason.

1:28:05.666 --> 1:28:07.125
Or you get into an accident!

1:28:07.791 --> 1:28:08.791
You'll be dead!

1:28:09.291 --> 1:28:10.583
Or homeless.

1:28:10.666 --> 1:28:12.291

Hey, Country Mouse…

[in English] Everything's fine?

1:28:21.875 --> 1:28:22.958
[in Hindi] First class.

1:28:24.708 --> 1:28:28.041
I hate to tell you this,
but all the drivers are talking about you.

1:28:28.583 --> 1:28:31.000
That you sit in your boss' car alone…

1:28:32.125 --> 1:28:34.000
muttering away to yourself.

1:28:36.125 --> 1:28:36.958
Is it true?

1:28:39.791 --> 1:28:41.833
[gunshots on TV]

1:28:45.375 --> 1:28:47.250
[Balram in English]
I would not let him tell me…

1:28:48.875 --> 1:28:51.250
my fate was a shack in a slum.

1:28:57.208 --> 1:29:01.833
Over the next weeks, I learned the ways
drivers cheat their masters.

1:29:01.916 --> 1:29:03.000
[both speaking Hindi]

1:29:10.958 --> 1:29:13.916
[Balram in English] Number one,
give your master phony invoices

1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:16.083
for repairs that are not necessary.

1:29:18.458 --> 1:29:19.375
Thank you, sir.

1:29:24.208 --> 1:29:27.583
Two, sell your master's petrol
to other drivers.

1:29:32.750 --> 1:29:34.166
As you gain confidence,

1:29:34.250 --> 1:29:37.208
cruise around picking up
and dropping off paying customers.

1:29:38.375 --> 1:29:39.875
Delhi has many pickup points.

1:29:40.541 --> 1:29:42.708
Over time, you will learn them all.

1:29:42.791 --> 1:29:43.666
[speaks Hindi]

1:29:44.833 --> 1:29:47.708
[Balram in English] When I looked
at that cash, I didn't feel guilt.

1:29:47.791 --> 1:29:48.791
[car honking]

1:29:48.875 --> 1:29:50.375
I felt rage.

1:29:52.291 --> 1:29:54.375
There are only two castes in India.

1:29:55.166 --> 1:29:57.166
I was growing a belly at last.

I'll fuck your mother.

1:30:01.041 --> 1:30:03.375
I'm trying to drive.
I can't pay attention like this.

1:30:03.458 --> 1:30:04.500
Take this.

1:30:05.583 --> 1:30:06.625
Take it!

1:30:06.708 --> 1:30:09.875
You're a eunuch,
you motherfucker! A eunuch!

1:30:16.291 --> 1:30:18.083
[in English] I know what you were doing.

1:30:18.166 --> 1:30:20.166
Sir, please don't get upset with me.

1:30:20.250 --> 1:30:23.041
You were at the temple
offering prayers for my health.

1:30:23.708 --> 1:30:24.541
Yes, sir.

1:30:26.166 --> 1:30:28.291
Yes, sir. I was so worried for you, sir.

1:30:29.583 --> 1:30:31.916
[in Hindi] I made an offering
of 101 rupees in your name.

1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:33.541
[in English] Come inside. Sit with me.

1:30:34.291 --> 1:30:35.166
Come.

1:30:37.416 --> 1:30:38.458
Come here.

1:30:40.541 --> 1:30:42.500
Is this really where you live?

1:30:43.583 --> 1:30:46.833
It's so damp, and the smell…

1:30:47.541 --> 1:30:49.833
This place is like
the Taj Mahal for me, sir.

1:30:49.916 --> 1:30:51.375
-Taj Mahal… [chuckles]
-Yes, sir.

1:30:51.458 --> 1:30:54.583
Taj Mahal is a tomb, Balram.
You don't live in Taj Mahal.

1:30:56.208 --> 1:30:57.041
Okay, sir.

1:30:58.333 --> 1:31:01.000
I have never done
what I wanted to do with my life.

1:31:02.125 --> 1:31:03.583
What did you want to do, sir?

1:31:03.666 --> 1:31:05.125
Music.

1:31:06.625 --> 1:31:08.166
Or produce it anyway.

1:31:09.333 --> 1:31:11.875
You know,
I lived in the US for so many years,

1:31:11.958 --> 1:31:13.833
and I'd try to be like them.

Indian at heart, after all.

1:33:34.833 --> 1:33:38.416
You know, I would not be able to afford
even one Johnnie Walker Black

1:33:38.500 --> 1:33:40.875
with the money I cheated
from my ex-employer,

1:33:40.958 --> 1:33:44.833
or get a room in this five-star hotel
with the money Pinky Madam had given me.

1:33:46.875 --> 1:33:51.291
Men born in the light, like my master,
have the choice to be good.

1:33:52.708 --> 1:33:57.583
Men born in the coop, like me,
we don't have that choice.

1:33:58.416 --> 1:34:00.291
[male reporter on car radio]
The opposition party and underdog,

1:34:00.375 --> 1:34:03.291
the Great Socialist,
hopes for support from rural India.

1:34:03.375 --> 1:34:04.708
[Mukesh] Her party is a mess.

1:34:04.791 --> 1:34:07.041
This government is
going to win this time for sure.

1:34:07.125 --> 1:34:09.166
We just need to keep paying them
until the elections.

1:34:09.250 --> 1:34:10.583
[Ashok] I can't keep doing this.

1:34:10.666 --> 1:34:13.125
[Mukesh] Things will change,
and then you do what you want to do.

1:34:13.208 --> 1:34:15.625
-[Ashok] It's getting tough.
-[Mukesh in Hindi] What the fuck was that?

1:34:15.708 --> 1:34:18.250
[in English] Who told you
to do that? Can you believe that?

1:34:18.333 --> 1:34:19.708
Why did you give him money, Balram?

1:34:19.791 --> 1:34:21.250
[in Hindi] Turn off the radio, asshole!

1:34:21.333 --> 1:34:23.708
This sister-fucker thinks
he's doing charity.

1:34:23.791 --> 1:34:24.833
[in English] Why'd he do that?

1:34:24.916 --> 1:34:26.375
[in Hindi]
Is that your father's money, dickhead?

1:34:26.458 --> 1:34:30.875
-[in English] Who do you think you are?
-Sorry, sir. It won't happen again.

1:34:34.625 --> 1:34:35.500
[indistinct conversation]

1:34:35.583 --> 1:34:37.958
[Balram] Be careful
what you say around drivers.

1:34:38.041 --> 1:34:40.375
We have grown skilled at reading lips.

1:34:40.458 --> 1:34:43.000
I was certain
I saw the Mongoose say my name,

1:34:43.083 --> 1:34:45.291
and then a word no servant wants to hear,

1:34:45.916 --> 1:34:47.208
"replacement."

1:34:54.208 --> 1:34:55.958
-To the Parliament House.
-Ji, sir.

1:34:58.541 --> 1:34:59.708
My phone. [sighs]

1:35:00.583 --> 1:35:02.041
Just keep it in the car.

1:35:25.125 --> 1:35:27.833
[Balram] This was at least
two years' salary, maybe three.

1:35:28.916 --> 1:35:30.208
I was worth more.

1:35:51.041 --> 1:35:54.541
Over the next days,
I tried hard not to look at the red bag.

1:36:00.583 --> 1:36:03.541
The city knew
something was burning inside of me,

1:36:03.625 --> 1:36:05.166
and she burned too.

1:36:15.708 --> 1:36:17.000
[horn honking]

1:36:20.875 --> 1:36:21.750
[Balram in Hindi] Dad?

1:36:23.958 --> 1:36:27.375
Even if you were to steal it…
it wouldn't be stealing.

1:36:27.458 --> 1:36:31.375
Mr. Ashok bribes politicians
in order not to pay taxes.

1:36:31.458 --> 1:36:33.041
So who is he stealing from?

1:36:33.125 --> 1:36:35.166
The ordinary people of this country.

1:36:36.750 --> 1:36:37.666
Me.

1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:40.000
And you.

1:36:41.791 --> 1:36:43.458
[vehicle horns blaring]

1:36:43.541 --> 1:36:44.625
[Ashok in English] Let's go.

1:36:45.666 --> 1:36:47.541
Balram, hey? Let's go.

1:36:53.583 --> 1:36:55.125
It'll be a couple of hours.

1:37:03.166 --> 1:37:05.000
[horn honking]

1:37:07.541 --> 1:37:09.416
[muffled announcement on PA system]

1:37:23.583 --> 1:37:27.375
[Balram] What would my destination be
if I came here with the red bag?

1:37:30.541 --> 1:37:33.000
-[dogs barking]
-[pigeons fluttering]

1:37:34.541 --> 1:37:36.875
The pigeons, the dog, the station.

1:37:36.958 --> 1:37:38.250
They could sense it.

1:37:38.333 --> 1:37:41.625
A rooster was trying
to escape from the coop.

1:37:44.041 --> 1:37:46.750
What would Mr. Ashok do to my family?

1:38:00.083 --> 1:38:01.166
[baby wailing]

1:38:03.416 --> 1:38:05.916
-[gunshot]
-[babies wailing]

1:38:43.083 --> 1:38:44.625
-Sir?
-Yeah?

1:38:49.583 --> 1:38:51.125
Sir, there is something…

1:38:53.541 --> 1:38:55.666
There is something
I want to tell you, sir.

1:38:56.375 --> 1:38:57.500
Yeah. Go ahead.

1:39:00.541 --> 1:39:04.000
Sir, I want to smash your skull
and steal your money.

1:39:06.208 --> 1:39:07.875
[Ashok] I know what you're thinking.

1:39:08.958 --> 1:39:10.458
You miss home, don't you?

1:39:11.625 --> 1:39:12.500
Yes, sir.

1:39:13.416 --> 1:39:14.625
Plan a trip back.

1:39:16.208 --> 1:39:17.083
And…

1:39:20.958 --> 1:39:23.541
Don't worry about the expenses. Here.

1:39:25.416 --> 1:39:27.625
-Yeah? Good night.
-Yes, sir.

1:39:35.958 --> 1:39:39.541
[Balram] He only gave me
enough for a one-way ticket.

1:39:40.500 --> 1:39:43.583
[indistinct chatter]

1:39:55.250 --> 1:39:57.250
[children speaking Hindi]

1:40:16.583 --> 1:40:18.166
[laughing]

1:40:29.125 --> 1:40:31.708
[both laughing maniacally]

1:40:43.916 --> 1:40:45.375
[male reporter on car radio]
Upending all expectations

1:40:45.458 --> 1:40:47.500
-and with the support of the poor…
-[cheering and shouting]

1:40:47.583 --> 1:40:51.125
…the Great Socialist has won
a vast majority of the votes

1:40:51.208 --> 1:40:53.083
saying, "There is no water in our taps,

1:40:53.166 --> 1:40:55.750
and what did
the rich politicians in Delhi give us?"

1:40:55.833 --> 1:40:56.666
"Cellphones."

1:40:56.750 --> 1:40:59.250
"Can a poor man drink
a phone when he is thirsty?"

1:40:59.333 --> 1:41:00.583
[Ashok] We went to the wrong side.

1:41:00.666 --> 1:41:02.916
-[in Hindi] Turn that shit off, asshole!
-[radio turns off]

1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:05.208
[in English]
I can't hear you. Say that again?

1:41:05.291 --> 1:41:07.541
-[indistinct shouting]
-I get it. Move! Back off!

1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:13.000
Yeah. All the idiot villagers
voted for her.

1:41:13.791 --> 1:41:15.541
What the fuck are we gonna do now?

1:41:16.125 --> 1:41:18.416
[in Hindi] Drive, sister-fucker!
Why'd you come this way?

1:41:18.500 --> 1:41:20.833
[drums beating]

1:41:22.041 --> 1:41:25.250
[crowd chanting in Hindi]
Long live socialism!

1:41:27.708 --> 1:41:29.916
[chanting gets louder]

1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:31.750
[vehicles honking]

1:41:41.083 --> 1:41:43.375
[Ashok in English] Father sends
his warm congratulations.

1:41:43.458 --> 1:41:45.625
We're all very happy for your success.

1:41:45.708 --> 1:41:47.291
So sweet of you.

1:41:48.500 --> 1:41:52.083
As a matter of fact, we would like
to show our appreciation by donating

1:41:52.166 --> 1:41:54.041
one million rupees to your party.

1:41:54.750 --> 1:41:57.583
[in Hindi] Is that how much you paid
the opposition party, fucker?

1:41:58.833 --> 1:42:02.416
We want four million rupees.
Monday night, Sheraton Hotel.

1:42:02.500 --> 1:42:03.458
Got it?

1:42:36.791 --> 1:42:40.666
[in Hindi] I took a bus
from the village, then caught a train…

1:42:42.041 --> 1:42:44.583
and got here
after asking around about you.

1:42:45.333 --> 1:42:49.291
Granny said you would look after me

1:42:49.375 --> 1:42:51.250
and help me become a driver.

1:42:55.208 --> 1:42:56.666
-Who are you?
-Dharam.

1:42:57.416 --> 1:42:59.041
Aunt Lattu's fourth son.

1:43:00.791 --> 1:43:02.500
-What's in your hand?
-A letter.

1:43:02.583 --> 1:43:04.625
-A letter?
-Hmm.

1:43:04.708 --> 1:43:05.750
Show it to me.

1:43:11.791 --> 1:43:12.958
[sighs]

1:43:14.875 --> 1:43:20.708
[Kusum] My dear grandson,
it has been seven months and two days…

1:43:20.791 --> 1:43:22.791
since you sent us money.

1:43:22.875 --> 1:43:25.791
The city has corrupted your soul.

1:43:26.333 --> 1:43:31.000
Life has become hard here.
Lord Indra is unhappy.

1:43:31.625 --> 1:43:35.166
You must send us money again.

1:43:36.166 --> 1:43:40.166
I have arranged for your wedding.

1:43:40.250 --> 1:43:46.541
If you don't come here,
we will send the girl to you by bus.

1:43:46.625 --> 1:43:48.750
If you refuse,

1:43:48.833 --> 1:43:52.833
we will write a letter explaining
everything and send it to your master.

1:43:52.916 --> 1:43:53.833
[paper rustling]

1:43:57.333 --> 1:43:59.458
[Balram] Is she really
going to marry me off?

1:44:00.125 --> 1:44:01.041
[Dharam in English] Yes, uncle.

1:44:02.375 --> 1:44:04.791
Turn around, I'm going to hit you again.

1:44:06.458 --> 1:44:07.541
Turn around!

1:44:13.416 --> 1:44:14.541
[sighs]

1:44:33.750 --> 1:44:37.041
[Balram] The next morning,
Mr. Ashok did something he had never done.

1:44:37.125 --> 1:44:37.958
[Ashok] Who is this?

1:44:38.041 --> 1:44:39.916
[Balram] He gave me a day off.

1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:42.208
-[Ashok] Your nephew?
-Ji, sir. My family.

1:44:43.041 --> 1:44:43.958
[speaks Hindi]

1:44:44.041 --> 1:44:47.916
[Balram in English] But by now, I knew
the rich never give anything for free.

1:44:52.333 --> 1:44:53.500
[indistinct conversation]

1:44:53.583 --> 1:44:55.208
He had found my replacement.

1:45:01.416 --> 1:45:02.666
[grunting]

1:45:16.250 --> 1:45:20.500
That's when we saw the creature that
gets born only once every generation…

1:45:22.458 --> 1:45:23.833
the white tiger.

1:46:09.708 --> 1:46:13.250
Iqbal, that great Muslim poet,
was right when he wrote,

1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:17.250
"The moment you recognize
what is beautiful in this world,

1:46:18.041 --> 1:46:19.458
you stop being a slave."

1:47:32.958 --> 1:47:36.291
I hoped the next morning
when I didn't return,

1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:38.291
he'd know to run.

1:47:42.916 --> 1:47:45.125
-[car door closes]
-[engine starts]

1:47:52.333 --> 1:47:53.583
[rain pattering]

1:48:06.250 --> 1:48:08.083
[thunder rumbling]

1:48:13.041 --> 1:48:14.166
The Sheraton, sir?

1:48:15.333 --> 1:48:17.208
Yeah, the Sheraton.

1:48:26.875 --> 1:48:27.750
[Ashok] Pinky called.

1:48:28.333 --> 1:48:30.708
She wants to know
if I'll move back to New York.

1:48:32.458 --> 1:48:33.875
Will you be going, sir?

1:48:34.375 --> 1:48:38.166
And pretend to be someone I'm not?
This is my country after all.

1:48:44.750 --> 1:48:48.500
There is a story about a cunning Brahmin
trying to trick the Buddha?

1:48:49.791 --> 1:48:51.000
The Brahmin asks,

1:48:52.041 --> 1:48:55.500
"Master, do you consider
yourself man or God?"

1:48:56.875 --> 1:48:59.625
To which the Buddha smiles
and says, "Neither."

1:49:00.375 --> 1:49:05.125
"I'm just one who has woken up
while the rest of you are still sleeping."

1:49:33.791 --> 1:49:35.875
What's wrong? Why'd you stop?

1:49:35.958 --> 1:49:38.125
There is something wrong
with the wheel, sir.

1:49:38.208 --> 1:49:40.750
Just give me a minute, sir. I'll go check.

1:49:40.833 --> 1:49:41.708
Okay.

1:50:09.541 --> 1:50:12.166
-What happened?
-There's something off with the wheel.

1:50:12.666 --> 1:50:13.625
Okay.

1:50:15.166 --> 1:50:16.583
Maybe we should call for help.

1:50:16.666 --> 1:50:18.541
-Huh, sir?
-We should call for help!

1:50:18.625 --> 1:50:20.416
Sir, who will come here, sir?

1:50:21.333 --> 1:50:23.416
If you can just step out, sir,
we can fix it together.

1:50:23.500 --> 1:50:25.541
No, no. It's raining. Let's call for help.

1:50:25.625 --> 1:50:28.291
What to do, sir?
You will get late otherwise.

1:50:28.375 --> 1:50:30.833
If you can just step outside,
it won't take much time.

1:50:32.833 --> 1:50:33.708
Okay.

1:50:37.833 --> 1:50:38.750
Ugh.

1:50:39.750 --> 1:50:41.625
-Be careful about the bottle.
-Yeah.

1:50:43.208 --> 1:50:45.125
I'll just put it out of the way.

1:50:46.500 --> 1:50:47.875
-This one?
-Yes, sir.

1:50:55.958 --> 1:50:57.708
-It seems fine to me.
-No, sir.

1:50:57.791 --> 1:51:00.833
You should've found
a replacement a long time ago!

1:51:03.916 --> 1:51:04.750
[Ashok groaning]

1:51:10.291 --> 1:51:12.750
[groaning]

1:51:33.166 --> 1:51:34.916
[groaning]

1:51:41.375 --> 1:51:42.708
[Ashok gurgling]

1:52:15.166 --> 1:52:17.208
[screaming]

1:52:36.041 --> 1:52:38.833
[laughing]

1:52:45.541 --> 1:52:46.958
[breathing heavily]

1:53:24.791 --> 1:53:27.458
[whispering in Hindi]

1:53:33.041 --> 1:53:36.666
[train horn blaring]

1:53:43.541 --> 1:53:45.666
[indistinct chatter]

1:54:06.625 --> 1:54:08.041
[train approaching]

1:54:13.958 --> 1:54:15.750
[train horn blowing]

1:54:25.916 --> 1:54:27.250
I am not a politician.

1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:31.541
They are extraordinary men
who can kill and move on.

1:54:32.291 --> 1:54:36.916
Not me. I didn't leave this room
for four weeks until my nerves were calm.

1:54:39.416 --> 1:54:41.666
The last stage in my amazing success story

1:54:41.750 --> 1:54:45.083
was to go from social entrepreneur
to business entrepreneur.

1:54:45.583 --> 1:54:46.666
This was not easy.

1:54:49.375 --> 1:54:50.541
But I had an edge.

1:54:50.625 --> 1:54:53.750
I had come to Bangalore,
and Mr. Ashok had told me the future.

1:54:54.750 --> 1:54:56.083
Outsourcing.

1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:05.208
[woman laughing]

1:55:10.666 --> 1:55:12.625
When I saw all those drivers

1:55:12.708 --> 1:55:15.375
coming in and out
of the call centers to America,

1:55:16.083 --> 1:55:17.791
I knew what my place would be.

1:55:20.291 --> 1:55:22.625
But how would I
get rid of the competition?

1:55:22.708 --> 1:55:24.208
[indistinct chatter]

1:55:26.833 --> 1:55:29.708
Then I wondered,
"What would Mr. Ashok do?"

1:55:30.625 --> 1:55:31.458
[cop] Sir!

1:55:34.291 --> 1:55:35.291
Namaste, sir.

1:55:36.208 --> 1:55:39.541
I just wanted to make
a small offering of my gratitude to you.

1:55:41.041 --> 1:55:41.875
For what?

1:55:42.416 --> 1:55:44.583
For all the good
you're going to do for me.

1:55:51.583 --> 1:55:55.041
Don't worry.
It wasn't all of it, but it was enough.

1:55:57.375 --> 1:55:59.333
You know why they never found me?

1:55:59.416 --> 1:56:02.500
Because my face could be
the face of half the men in India.

1:56:03.500 --> 1:56:04.875
[police siren wailing]

1:56:05.875 --> 1:56:10.291
The police arrested all the call-center
drivers for expired licenses.

1:56:11.208 --> 1:56:13.625
Entrepreneurs create opportunity.

1:56:14.166 --> 1:56:16.000
That's how I got my own startup.

1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:19.625
White Tiger Drivers.

1:56:20.708 --> 1:56:24.458
I've got 30 drivers
who work in shifts with 26 vehicles,

1:56:24.541 --> 1:56:27.041
all air-conditioned for the summer months.

1:56:28.250 --> 1:56:30.333
Put together with my bank holdings,

1:56:30.416 --> 1:56:34.416
and I am worth 15 times the sum
I borrowed from Mr. Ashok.

1:56:36.708 --> 1:56:38.875
Your Excellency, please visit my website.

1:56:38.958 --> 1:56:41.875
If you like what you see,
you can click where it says…

1:56:45.166 --> 1:56:46.416
Yes, Ashok.

1:56:47.208 --> 1:56:49.458
That's what I call myself these days.

1:56:51.416 --> 1:56:54.125
But I don't treat
my drivers like servants.

1:56:54.208 --> 1:56:58.750
I don't care about their religion,
and I certainly don't call them my family.

1:56:58.833 --> 1:57:00.708
They are my employees.

1:57:00.791 --> 1:57:03.708
I make them sign a contract,
and I sign it too.

1:57:05.500 --> 1:57:08.041
And if there is a problem,

1:57:08.125 --> 1:57:10.166
I don't let my drivers take the blame.

1:57:10.250 --> 1:57:11.541
[man] Can't we take him to the hospital?

1:57:11.625 --> 1:57:13.166
That's the brother of the dead boy.

1:57:13.791 --> 1:57:15.708
And your driver
that hit him is right there.

1:57:15.791 --> 1:57:17.708
[Balram]
Namaskar, my name is Ashok Sharma.

1:57:17.791 --> 1:57:22.166
I am the owner of this vehicle.
The blood is on my hands, not my driver.

1:57:22.250 --> 1:57:25.083
It's a terrible tragedy
that has happened, but it's late…

1:57:25.166 --> 1:57:28.083
[Balram] I choose to do things
differently than my masters.

1:57:29.125 --> 1:57:30.416
I live in the light now.

1:57:31.333 --> 1:57:34.625
[Balram] I want to express my deep sorrow
at the loss of your son, aunty.

1:57:34.708 --> 1:57:36.708
There is 40,000 rupees in this.

1:57:36.791 --> 1:57:39.958
I don't give it to you
because I need to, but because I want to.

1:57:40.041 --> 1:57:41.416
[Balram in Kannada] Do you understand?

1:57:41.958 --> 1:57:43.583
[in English]
And I want to help your other son.

1:57:44.333 --> 1:57:48.375
He can come and be a driver with me,
and I will take care of him.

1:57:56.458 --> 1:57:58.500
[Balram]
I do think about my ex a lot,

1:57:59.583 --> 1:58:00.541
and I do miss him.

1:58:02.541 --> 1:58:04.166
He didn't deserve his fate.

1:58:06.708 --> 1:58:09.958
Ah, I should have cut the Mongoose's neck.

1:58:15.500 --> 1:58:18.125
[Balram] I'll never know
what happened to my family.

1:58:20.750 --> 1:58:21.916
I could only wonder.

1:58:26.875 --> 1:58:30.416
But for the poor,
there are only two ways to get to the top,

1:58:30.500 --> 1:58:32.625
crime or politics.

1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:35.916
Is it like that in your country too?

1:58:38.291 --> 1:58:39.500
[sighs]

1:58:40.541 --> 1:58:42.458
Do you think about your mom and dad?

1:58:44.916 --> 1:58:47.041
Give me another glass of milk,
won't you, uncle?

1:58:47.125 --> 1:58:48.416
And a bowl of ice cream too.

1:58:48.500 --> 1:58:49.916
You know ice cream is for Sundays.

1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:53.166
No. It's for today.

1:58:55.166 --> 1:58:56.291
[Balram] Smart boy.

1:59:12.333 --> 1:59:13.625
-It's this car?
-Sir.

1:59:13.708 --> 1:59:15.166

Your Excellency,
it's me from our email, sir.

1:59:19.583 --> 1:59:21.333
The White Tiger, Ashok Sharma.
How are you?

1:59:21.416 --> 1:59:24.000
We great entrepreneurs always have
our sights set on tomorrow.

1:59:24.083 --> 1:59:25.416
Real estate.

1:59:25.916 --> 1:59:28.208
With all the American companies
coming to Bangalore,

1:59:28.291 --> 1:59:29.791
the white people need a place to sleep.

1:59:29.875 --> 1:59:31.333
[Jiabao] Thank you, sir.

1:59:31.416 --> 1:59:32.291
Enjoy India, sir.

1:59:32.375 --> 1:59:33.750
[indistinct chatter]

1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:39.833
White people
are on their way out, you know.

1:59:40.583 --> 1:59:42.416
They'll be finished within our lifetime.

1:59:44.041 --> 1:59:46.166
It's the century
of the brown man and the yellow man,

1:59:46.250 --> 1:59:48.166
and God save everybody else.

1:59:53.458 --> 1:59:56.750
And sometimes I think,
even if they did catch me,

1:59:56.833 --> 1:59:59.000
I'll never say I made a mistake.

1:59:59.083 --> 2:00:01.041
It was all worthwhile to know,

2:00:01.125 --> 2:00:05.000
just for a day,
just for an hour, just for a minute,

2:00:06.333 --> 2:00:09.375
what it means not to be a servant.

2:00:11.375 --> 2:00:12.500
[knocking at door]

2:00:18.333 --> 2:00:22.458
Now, what happens
in a typical Hindi film about murder?

2:00:22.541 --> 2:00:25.333
A poor man kills a rich man,
and then gets nightmares

2:00:25.416 --> 2:00:29.250
about the dead man pursuing him,
screaming, "Murderer! Shame!"

2:00:30.083 --> 2:00:31.708
It doesn't happen like that.

2:00:31.791 --> 2:00:35.041
The real nightmare is the other kind
where you feel like you didn't do it,

2:00:35.125 --> 2:00:38.083
that you didn't kill your master,
that you lost your nerve,

2:00:38.166 --> 2:00:41.375
and that you're still
a servant to another man.

2:00:42.166 --> 2:00:43.291
But then you wake up…

2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:46.333
the sweating stops, your heartbeat slows.

2:00:46.416 --> 2:00:48.041
The nightmare is over.

2:00:48.875 --> 2:00:50.125
You did do it.

2:00:50.208 --> 2:00:51.750
You killed your master.

2:00:55.291 --> 2:00:56.125
[sighs]

2:00:56.916 --> 2:00:58.375
I've switched sides.

2:00:59.708 --> 2:01:02.000
I've made it. I've broken out of the coop.
