I know you Chinese are great lovers
of freedom and individual liberty.

57
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,083
The British tried
to make you their servants,

00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,833
but you never let them.

59
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,500
I admire that, Mr. Premier.

After them, my sly, old Granny, Kusum.

She had forced my brother,
Kishan, to work in the tea shop.

75
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,833
And she took every rupee
from my father, a rickshaw puller.

00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,833

00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,291
in its 10,000-year history…

173
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,500
the rooster coop.

174
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,666
They can see and smell the blood.

175
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,083
They know they are next,
yet they don't rebel.

176
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,083
They don't try and get out of the coop.

177
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:26,166
Servants here
have been raised to behave the same.

178
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,375
[rickshaw bell rings]

179
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,958
The furniture on his back
is worth at least two years his salary,

180
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,500
and yet he will faithfully pedal
the money back to his boss

181
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,083
without ever touching a single rupee.

182
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,500
No servant does.

183
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:43,208
Why? Because Indians are the world's
most honest and spiritual people?

184
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,916
No.

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,208
It's because 99.9% of us
are caught in the rooster coop.

186
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,041
The trustworthiness
of servants is so strong

187
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:56,583
that you can put
the key of emancipation in a man's hand

188
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,416
and he will throw it
back at you with a curse.

189
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,250
[indistinct chatter]

190
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,375
I had learned to use my time
to eavesdrop on customers,

191
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,458
waiting for an opportunity.

192
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,791
[in Hindi] Would you like some tea?
Put on some tea!

193
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,250
[in English] Something my brother
had given up on long ago.

194
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,791
[in Hindi] Make it quickly.

195
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,625
[indistinct chatter]

196
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,333
Are you deaf? Get to work.

[car honking]

199
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,750
[children chattering]

200
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,916
[Balram in English] I know communists
like you don't believe in God, sir,

201
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,166
but do you believe in fate?

202
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,833
That was when I first saw him,
the Stork's youngest son, Mr. Ashok.

203
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,833
He had just moved from America
back to India, to Dhanbad,

204
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,250
where his family
had made a fortune in coal.

205
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:08,000
I knew then, this was the master for me.

206
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:26,458
[Balram in Hindi] I overheard them saying
they need a second driver for Mr. Ashok.

207
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,041
He's just come back--

208
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,041
But you don't know how to drive!

209
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:36,125
I just need 300 rupees
for the driving lessons and--

210
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:40,541
No! You've always
been insolent like your father.

211
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,000
You'll stay right here with Kishan.

212
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,166
[Balram in English]
Granny had married him off,

213
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,708
given him two weeks
to dip his beak into his wife,

214
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,458
and now he was stuck here.

215
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:51,750
I would be too.

216
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,333
[in Hindi] Okay, forget it.

217
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,750
I thought if I became their driver,
you'd buy a bunch of water buffaloes…

218
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,250
and be the envy of the village.

219
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:06,375
So you'll become
a driver for the landlords?

220
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,041
You could be
the richest woman in the village.

221
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:15,375
[scoffs] Swear on all the gods
you believe in

222
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:19,708
that you'll send every rupee,

223
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,791
-every month, to your Granny.
-[repeats in Hindi]

224
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,833
-I swear.
-Stop smiling!

225
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,333
Pinch your hand and swear!

226
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,416
I'm pinching! Granny, just think…

227
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,875
You'll become
the richest woman in the village.

228
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,541
This cane will become gold,
and when you swing it like this,

229
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,666
the entire village
will line up to see you.

230
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,583
[Kishan] Wait! Granny made your favorite!

231
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,583
You eat your oily okra!
I'm gonna eat in Dhanbad!

232
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,958
[Kishan shouts in Hindi]

233
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:55,458
[men singing in Hindi]

234
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,208
[vehicles honking]

235
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,666
[Balram in English] And now,
I just had to learn to drive.

236
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,208
[instructor speaking Hindi]

237
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,583
[in English] Right. Right. Right.

238
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,666
[in Hindi] Watch out, sister-fucker!

239
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,125
You're from a caste of sweet makers.

240
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,791
Only a boy from a warrior class
can tame a wild stallion.

241
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:38,250
Muslims, Rajputs, Sikhs
have aggression in their blood.

242
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:43,291
Why don't you stick to making sweets?

243
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,666
[tires screeching]

244
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,083
It's not enough to drive.
You've got to become a driver.

245
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,625
Anyone tries to overtake you, do this…

246
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,541
Out of the way, sister-fucker!

247
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:57,708
[honking]

248
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,708
-[Balram] Outta my way, fucker!
-[driver cursing in Hindi]

249
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,708
The road is a jungle.

250
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:07,041
A good driver
must roar to get ahead on it!

251
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,500
-[engine revving]
-[honks]

252
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,958
[Balram in English] It wasn't
so hard to find out where they lived.

253
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,875
I just had to get through the door.

254
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,666
-[in Hindi] Yeah?
-Namaste, sir.

255
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,916
[in Hindi] What do you want?

256
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,708
Any need of a driver, sir?

257
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,750
I've got four years' experience.
My master recently died, so I--

258
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,750
Get lost. We have a driver already.

259
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,416
I see you have two cars, sir,
but do you have two drivers?

260
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,458
What's wrong with you?
Get lost, motherfucker.

261
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,458
Sir? This is your house?

262
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,375
[in English] Namaste, sir. I'm from
your village, sir! From Laxmangarh.

263
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,958
-[in Hindi] Laxmangarh?
-Yes, sir!

264
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,791
The gods must be watching over us!

265
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,833
[in English] I used to work at
the tea stall, sir, at the main junction!

266
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,791
And I would bring tea
to your Ambassador car.

267
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,250
-[speaks Hindi]
-Let the boy in.

268
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,083
-But, sir--
-[The Stork] Let him in.

269
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,541
I can't believe it's you, sir.

270
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,333
How the crops died since you left.

271
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,791
And we prayed that…

272
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,750
[in English] …you should have more sons
to keep rule in the village, sir.

273
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,916
[in Hindi] Get up.

274
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,750
[in English] Do people still remember me?

275
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,250
[in Hindi] Of course, sir.

276
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,666
[in English] We all say
our father is gone, sir.

277
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:27,291
The best and the most holy
of the landlords, like Gandhi-ji, sir.

278
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,333
Like Gandhi?

279
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,500
Ji, sir. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi-ji.

280
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,500
Okay. Okay.

281
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,541
What do you want?

282
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,250
Sir, with your permission, sir,

283
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,125
I want to be a driver for you…
or for your son.

284
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,458
-Are you Muslim?
-[in Hindi] No, sir.

285
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,791
[in English] I bathe regularly,
keep myself clean, sir, and I'm not lazy.

286
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,875
-Hey, I'm Ashok.
-Hey, don't do that.

287
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,166
You need a driver,
let's take him for a spin.

288
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,833
-See how good he is.
-[in Hindi] Yes, sir.

289
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,541
[in English] Just my luck, the Mongoose.

290
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,083
-[The Stork in Hindi] He drives well.
-[in English] Yeah.

291
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,958
-[in Hindi] What's your caste?
-Halwai, sir.

292
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,666
Is that a high caste or low?

293
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,166
[Balram in English] In the old days,

294
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,250
when India was
the richest nation on Earth,

295
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,416
there were 1,000 castes and destinies.

296
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,625
These days, there are just two castes.

297
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:12,458
Men with big bellies
and men with small bellies.

298
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,958
And there are only two destinies,
eat or get eaten up.

299
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,875
-[in Hindi] Low caste, sir.
-Ugh!

300
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,916
-All our servants are high caste.
-[in English] Why does his caste matter?

301
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,791
-[in Hindi] You drink?
-No, sir.

302
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,500
-[in English] In my caste we never drink.
-So what do you do?

303
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,458
[in Hindi] Steal?

304
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,125
Halwai?

305
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,791
-You're a sweet maker?
-Yes, sir.

306
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,916
[in English] That's why
you're so sweet to us?

307
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,500
-Do you cook?
-Certainly, sir. Very well.

308
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,000
-Like what?
-Sir, all kinds of sweets, sir.

309
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:43,833
Gulab jamun, rasgulla ho gaya,
ladoo, rasmalai, kaju barfi.

310
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,416
[in Hindi] Whatever you like, sir.

311
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,541
[in English] The driver can cook too.
Only in India. Can you start tomorrow?

312
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,541
Not so fast, bhai.
We'll have to check on his family first.

313
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,458
-[in Hindi] How much you want?
-I don't want any money, sir.

314
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:59,083
[in English] You are like parents to me.
How can I ask my parents for money?

315
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,416
Fifteen-hundred a month.

316
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,291
[in Hindi] No, sir, that's too much.

317
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,458
[in English] Give me
half of that, sir. It's enough.

318
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:07,541
If we keep you
beyond two months, it will go to 2,000.

319
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,000
And you only drive me.

320
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:09,958
[in Hindi] Yes, sir.

321
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,041
[honking]

322
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:16,375
-[in English] Can you honk less?
-[in Hindi] Bro, you wanna climb in here?

323
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,583
-Get moving!
-Watch how you drive!

324
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:22,791
-[in English] Why'd you do that? Don't.
-[in Hindi] Get the rod? Get the rod.

325
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:27,166
I know you're play-acting.
You haven't been hired yet, hick!

326
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,291
[Balram in English] The Mongoose
must have called his man in Laxmangarh,

327
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,041
because two days later
when they did hire me,

328
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,125
they knew everything about my family.

329
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:45,166
The pride and glory
of our nation, the Indian family.

330
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:52,041
Every master has to know exactly where
their servant's family live at all times

331
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:55,500
just in case a servant decides
to steal from his employer and run.

332
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:56,791
If so…

333
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,333
[gunshot]

334
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,291
Fair enough. I would do the same.

335
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,791
[man speaks Hindi]

336
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,666
[Balram in English]
But it's what the masters do

337
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,333
to their servants' families.

338
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,541
[gun cocking]

339
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,458
[gunshot]

340
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,458
This is how the rooster coop works.

341
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:26,250
This is how it traps so many millions
of men and women in India.

342
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:30,750
So rest assured, the Stork
and his sons could count on my loyalty.

343
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,000
[in Hindi] This is the room.

344
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,875
This is my room?

345
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,208
You'll share it with me.

346
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,666
I'll find a mattress
from the store for you.

347
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,291
No, there's no need for that.

348
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,458
I'll be quite comfortable on the floor.
Nothing to worry about.

349
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,708
-There's even a first class roof!
-[chuckles]

350
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,250
Here. You're to wear this at all times.

351
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:56,958
-[Balram] It's mine?
-Yes.

352
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,541
-Hey, hero!
-Yes, sir?

353
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,166
I hope you like carpets.

354
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,208
When you're done cleaning those,
wash all the windows.

355
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,500
Got it?

356
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,083
But I'm the driver, sir.

357
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,791
No. You're the "number two" driver.

358
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,166
[speaking in Hindi]

359
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,125
[Balram in English]
Is there any hatred on Earth

360
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,416
like the hatred of the number-two servant
for the number one?

361
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:57,791
While I cleaned,
he strolled about like a master.

362
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:02,750
He had every Hindu God lined up
and was always praying,

363
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:07,000
as if to accuse me of being a Naxal,
a communist, like you, sir.

364
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,458
I would not let him out pray me.

365
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,333
[both singing in Sanskrit]

366
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,583
[in Hindi] Sir,
why is Ram Persad not eating?

367
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:28,875
-And his mouth stinks these days.
-You keep your mouth shut.

368
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,250
[continues speaking in Hindi]

369
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,916
[Balram in English]
This man was hiding something,

370
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,833
and a successful entrepreneur
always finds his competition's secrets.

371
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,916
[Ashok and Pinky grunt]

372
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:48,666
[Pinky] Good job. Good. Did you hear that?
Yeah, that was good, right?

373
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:54,125
Hey, driver!
Hey, driver. Can you come here, please?

374
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,875
[Pinky] All right,
I need you to lie down for this…

375
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,166
Hey! Come in.

376
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,625
I wanted to ask you some questions.

377
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:04,250
Hey, could you
turn around for me for a second?

378
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,708
-[Balram] Yes.
-[Pinky] No!

379
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:08,958
[chuckles] That's not what I meant.
Just stand here.

380
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:11,958
Um, I feel like your back's…

381
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,708
[Balram] I'm ashamed to admit it now,

382
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:16,583
but in that moment I thought
Mr. Ashok's wife, Pinky Madam,

383
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,208
was one of "those women."

384
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,666
[Pinky] Oh, I'm so sorry,
I didn't even introduce myself.

385
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,250
Hi, I'm Pinky. Nice to meet you.

386
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,541
Honey, honey, all right.
I need to talk to him.

387
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,375
-All right. Okay.
-I need to talk.

388
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:31,541
So, uh, driver. We're both…
I'm sorry. What's your name?

389
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,208
-Sir, Balram, sir.
-[Ashok] Yeah, Balram.

390
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:36,500
So, Balram,
do you know what the Internet is?

391
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,291
No, sir, but I could drive
to the market right now, sir,

392
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,500
and get as many as you want.

393
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:43,708
No, it's okay. Thank you.

394
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,291
Do you have Facebook?

395
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,208
Yes, sir. Books.
I always loved books, sir.

396
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:52,166
Yeah, I heard you can read.
Have you ever seen a computer?

397
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,375
Yes, sir. Actually, we had many of them
in the village, with the goats.

398
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,500
-[Ashok] Goats?
-Ji, sir.

399
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:00,000
The goats
are pretty advanced to use computers.

400
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,541
[Balram] I could tell from their faces
I had made a mistake.

401
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:05,666
Pinky, you see. He's got two,
three years schooling in him.

402
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,500
He can read and write,
but he doesn't get what he's read.

403
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,125
He's half-baked.

404
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,416
Okay, now you're being a jerk.
He's standing right there.

405
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,791
-I'm not being a jerk.
-[Pinky] Come on, Ashok.

406
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,166
You're missing the point, Pinky.

407
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,208
Our driver represents
the biggest untapped market in India,

408
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,166
waiting to surf the web, buy a cell phone,
rise up into middle class.

409
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,833
Something I can help him do.

410
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,125
You're the new India, Balram.

411
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,666
I am the new India, sir.

412
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:34,125
You can go.

413
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:43,000
[Balram] I didn't like the way
he had spoken about me.

414
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:46,166
"Half-baked." But he was right.

415
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,791
When you come to India, sir,

416
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:50,333
you'll meet hundreds
of millions of men like me.

417
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:54,250
Open up our brown skulls
and look inside with a penlight.

418
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:58,166
You'll find all these ideas,
half-formed, half-correct,

419
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,458
all buggering one another,
and that is what we live and act on.

420
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:04,166
[both speaking in Hindi]

421
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,666
[The Stork] Ah!

422
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,916
[in Hindi] Very good.
A little higher. Yeah, there.

423
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,875
[in English] Papa, India's future is in
outsourcing with American companies.

424
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:21,250
Our future is China. They're building
superhighways, they need coal,

425
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,458
and we sell coal.

426
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:25,666
But I really think we should diversify.
The IT sector is booming, the Internet--

427
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,791
Internet? What is that?

428
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,208
Coal is real. I can touch it.

429
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:34,208
No, sir. I learned from Ashok Sir,
the Internet is as real as a spider's web,

430
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:37,125
that it connects
all the human beings across--

431
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:39,041
-[in Hindi] Know what that was for?
-Yes, sir.

432
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:40,083
[in English] What for?

433
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:43,166
-For the Internet, sir.
-Hey!

434
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,125
You're pressing it too hard.
Papa is getting annoyed. Slow down.

435
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,083
[The Stork] Hmm.

436
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:48,666
[Ashok] Why do you hit the servants?

437
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,916
In America, they can sue you for that.

438
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,666
[The Stork] This is not America, son.

439
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,625
[in Hindi] They respect us for that.
Remember that.

440
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:57,083
Hey, a little higher.

441
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,166
[toilet flushing]

442
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,416
[sniffs]

443
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,291
[sniffing]

444
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:37,250
[The Mongoose] Hmm.

445
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:39,166
Count it.

446
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,333
I don't want to hear shit later.

447
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:44,750
[Balram in English]
I was only allowed to keep 200.

448
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:45,666
[in Hindi] Good, sir.

449
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,083
[in English] Granny sent Kishan
each month to take the rest back to her.

450
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:52,666
[in Hindi] And they're not
from the same caste. She's a Christian.

451
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,041
-And he married her?
-Yeah.

452
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:56,750
That's normal in America.

453
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,416
Her people were against it, too,
but he wouldn't listen.

454
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,000
-Is she American?
-No, no, she's Indian.

455
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:07,250
She was born here.
She moved there when she was 12.

456
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,750
She told me.

457
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,291
She talks to you?

458
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:12,625
Talks to me?

459
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:15,125
She tells me everything.

460
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:17,166
I'm their number one driver.

461
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,833
Are you serious?

462
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,416
Can I also come inside?

463
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,416
-It's not allowed.
-Why?

464
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:27,666
What do you mean, "why"?
If Mukesh sees, he'll scold me.

465
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:31,875
-Take care.
-Yes, you too.

466
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,083
[inhales deeply]

467
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,000
[grunting]

468
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,250
[sizzling]

469
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:11,625
[muezzin calling
on loudspeaker in distance]

470
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,333
[indistinct chatter]

471
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:30,375
[Balram in English] What a fool
I had been. It was Ramadan.

472
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,041
Of course he couldn't eat
and drink during the day.

473
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,750
The number one driver was a Muslim,
and the Stork hated Muslims.

474
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:44,458
-[car door opens]
-[footsteps approaching]

475
00:28:45,416 --> 00:28:46,250
[car door closes]

476
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:49,416
[in Hindi] As long as there is a sun
and a moon, madam's name will remain!

477
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,166
Long live the madam!
Long live socialism!

478
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,750
[Balram in English] I almost fell down.

479
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:58,208
There was the woman I had seen
on a million election posters

480
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:59,416
since I was a boy.

481
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,291
The Great Socialist.

482
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:05,625
She was a low caste,
like me and everyone from the darkness.

483
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:07,208
Like a good entrepreneur,

484
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:10,625
she had pulled herself up
to become chief minister of our state.

485
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:14,666
She knew how to stick it to the rich,
and we liked her for that.

486
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,833
You take coal from the government mines

487
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:20,750
without paying taxes
because I let it happen.

488
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,291
[The Stork] And we have shown
our appreciation for that, madam.

489
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,583
Two million rupees is a little too much.

490
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:26,750
We'll be happy for some--

491
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:29,041
[in Hindi] Son! Come here.

492
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:31,833
-[in English] Did you need something?
-I can get it.

493
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:33,625
[The Great Socialist in Hindi]
Come here, son.

494
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:34,541
Come here, fucker!

495
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:42,291
Your rich employers
are trying to bugger me.

496
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:44,500
What do you say to that?

497
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:45,625
Driver, get lost.

498
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:47,583
Shut up, mother-fucker!

499
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:50,708
[in English] You don't want
to pay the government, pay me.

500
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:52,041
2.5 million rupees.

501
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:53,875
And I mean it!

502
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,958
[The Great Socialist spits]

503

837
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:22,583
Stop thinking of yourself
and start thinking of the family.

838
00:48:24,541 --> 00:48:25,458
Eat.

839
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:26,666
[speaks Hindi]

840
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:29,916
-You're not Ashok Sir.
-Did you not understand?

841
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,083
Are you going to force me?
I don't want to get married!

842
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:34,166
You're driving me insane.

843
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:35,625
[Kishan] Munna!

844
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:40,416
Where are you going? Stop!

845
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:42,333
What happened?

846
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:45,583
-You must keep sending money.
-I won't send it.

847
00:48:45,666 --> 00:48:47,041
That's the family's money!

848
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:51,541
She's sucked the blood
out of you and left you a shell.

849
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:53,875
And she'll leave you to die, like Dad.

850
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:16,375
[Ashok in English] Why don't I eat meat?
Why does Pinky wear pants?

851
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:18,458
Why don't we have kids? They won't stop.

852
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:20,625
[Balram] I think
we should not go back there, sir.

853
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:21,958
[Ashok] Maybe.

854
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:23,625
[distant mooing]

855
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:27,041
You know, one in every three buildings
in India is built in Bangalore.

856
00:49:27,583 --> 00:49:28,458
You know why?

857
00:49:28,958 --> 00:49:31,625
-Outsourcing with the US.
-[Balram] Diversifying, sir?

858
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,625
[Ashok] Yeah, right. Not bad, Balram.

859
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:36,666
[Balram chuckles]

860
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:39,916
I'm thinking to offer financial services.

861
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:42,791
There's so many Wall Street firms I know.

862
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:46,458
I can drive you
to Bangalore right now, sir.

863
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:48,666
-Right now?
-Yes, sir.

864
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:52,250
-It's on the opposite side of the country.
-It's okay, sir.

865
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:54,416
I don't need sleep. I can drive all night.

866
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:56,125
No, thank you.

867
00:49:56,833 --> 00:50:00,208
I got to make a business plan first.
Do it the right way.

868
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,208
You will, sir. You will.

869
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,250
Yes. I will.

870
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:06,541
-[Pinky] Ashoky!
-Yeah?

871
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:10,583
[Balram] If only Mr. Ashok
was a real entrepreneur,

872
00:50:10,666 --> 00:50:13,333
if only we had left for Bangalore
that very day,

873
00:50:14,708 --> 00:50:16,583
then things would've
turned out differently for us.

874
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:23,541
Rich men are born
with opportunities they can waste.

875
00:50:25,416 --> 00:50:27,416
[children chattering]

876
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:29,250
But a poor man?

877
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:37,416
Feels like, "Are we gonna go back home,
or does he want to stay here?"

878
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,291
You need to talk. Put your foot down.

879
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:41,833
Yeah, but he's not had
that conversation with me.

880
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:44,583
I think he's being vague
because he hasn't figured it out--

881
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,916
Balram! What are you doing?

882
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,291
-Your ginger teas, madam?
-With your hand.

883
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:50,875
[in Hindi] What's he doing?

884
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:52,791
[woman in English]
Pinky, this is disgusting.

885
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:56,000
Your uniform is filthy and your mouth
smells of that paan all day. Just…

886
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:58,625
Ugh! Just pick up this tea and leave.

887
00:50:59,291 --> 00:51:00,833
-[in Hindi] Bring another cup.
-Yes, Madam.

888
00:51:00,916 --> 00:51:02,250
After you wash your hands.

889
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:04,583
[Pinky in English]
He's not usually like that. I'm sorry.

890
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:07,125
[woman] These lower castes, na,
they're all the same.

891
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:09,458
-See you soon.
-[Pinky] Keep visiting, okay?

892
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:11,833
-[woman] Talk to Ashok, yeah?
-I will. Bye.

893
00:51:14,833 --> 00:51:16,958
-Balram?
-Ji, madam?

894
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:18,125
[Pinky] Come here, please.

895
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:23,083
-Come here.
-Madam, I'm really sorry. I will stop.

896
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:26,416
-It's fine. Sit. Sit.
-I will stop eating paan, madam.

897
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,041
No. That's not what I'm… Just sit down.

898
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:32,416
I think it's wrong
the way you work for us.

899
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,708
You should be finishing your education,
starting your own family.

900
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:37,875
Ashok Sir and you are family to me, madam.

901
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:41,333
-Don't say that. That's not true, Balram.
-Really, madam.

902
00:51:41,416 --> 00:51:43,833
No, you can't possibly believe that.

903
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:48,750
Do you know what my parents do in America?

904
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:51,541
They run this shitty little bodega
in Jackson Heights,

905
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,291
selling beer, paan, and porn.

906
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:56,500
I used to do my homework in the basement.

907
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:59,208
One night I saw my mom
being held at gunpoint,

908
00:51:59,291 --> 00:52:01,458
and she still finished
working the entire night.

909
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:03,500
I got out, Balram.

910
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,625
What is it that you want to do?

911
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:09,583
-I want to serve you and Ashok Sir.
-No.

912
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:11,166
-Okay, stop. No.
-Really, madam.

913
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:15,958
Stop saying that. That's why this
caste system thing is total bullshit.

914
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:18,458
You know, Mukesh tried
to stop Ashok from marrying me

915
00:52:18,541 --> 00:52:20,291
because of this caste thing.

916
00:52:22,458 --> 00:52:23,416
Well, fuck him.

917
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:26,166
And fuck that.

918
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:46,333
[sniffs]

919
00:52:55,708 --> 00:52:57,458
[indistinct chatter]

920
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:06,625
-[Balram in Hindi] Is this toothpaste?
-Yes, it's terrific, whiten your teeth.

921
00:53:06,708 --> 00:53:09,500
-Where can I find something for an itch?
-[man 1] The medicine shop.

922
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:10,541
[man 2] Five hundred!

923
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:13,375
-Are these for the office?
-Yep, take a look.

924
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:17,083
[man 2] Those are 200.
This is leather, better quality.

925
00:53:17,166 --> 00:53:19,083
[Balram speaking Hindi]

926
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:21,583
Hundred-rupee sale!

927
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:26,541
-How much?
-A hundred rupees sale!

928
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:27,708
Pick any one.

929
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,166
And 250 for the pant.

930
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:32,000
It's a good designer pant.

931
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:44,541
[Balram in English] Why had my father
never told me not to scratch my groin?

932
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:49,250
Why had he never taught me
to brush my teeth?

933
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:54,083
Why had he raised me
to live like such an animal?

934
00:54:03,791 --> 00:54:07,541
If only a man
could spit his past out so easily.

935
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,833
If you asked me to explain
how one event connects to another

936
00:54:16,916 --> 00:54:20,041
or how one motive
strengthens or weakens the next,

937
00:54:20,916 --> 00:54:23,125
I'll tell you
I don't understand these things.

938
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:24,166
[squishing]

939
00:54:31,208 --> 00:54:34,916
I should warn you
my story gets much darker from here.

940
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:48,500
[Pinky] Is something going
to jump out at me?

941
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:49,625
[Pinky chuckles]

942
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:52,208
Oh, my gosh!

943
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:55,625
Happy birthday, madam.
Wish you many happy returns of the day.

944
00:54:55,708 --> 00:54:59,041
-Oh, baboo. That's great.
-How's he looking?

945
00:54:59,125 --> 00:55:00,541
-Please come in, Mr. Maharaja.
-Come in.

946
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:02,666
[muffled dance music playing]

947
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:04,125
[indistinct chatter]

948
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,791
[in Hindi] Hey! Country Mouse!

949
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:08,375
[makes kissing sound]

950
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:10,958
Don't stand there alone.
Come hang with us.

951
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,291
Standing alone leads to bad thoughts.

952
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:16,708
Look at him!
Dressed like the maharaja of England!

953
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,291
[driver 1] Hope you haven't
peed your pants.

954
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:21,208
Someone get him a diaper.

955
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:22,208
[cackling]

956
00:55:23,125 --> 00:55:25,291
-[driver 1] Asshole!
-[driver 2] I'll lube you up…

957
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:27,958
[driver 1] How's your room?

958
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:31,000
[driver 2] Are there cockroaches in there?

959
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:35,250
[strong wind blowing]

960
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:38,625
-[Ashok in English] It's fine…
-So great. Oh, my gosh, babe, he's asleep.

961
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:42,791
-Balram!
-No! Don't wake him up! He's sleeping.

962
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:45,583
-How do we get home? Just wait--
-[clicks tongue]

963
00:55:45,666 --> 00:55:48,333
Let me do it. I'll do it gently.
[in sing-song voice] Balram.

964
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:50,666
[loudly] Balram!

965
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,750
[Pinky and Ashok laughing]

966
00:55:52,833 --> 00:55:55,583
Oh, my God.
I think he just shat his pants.

967
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:56,791
I'm so sorry.

968
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:59,583
-Oh, my God. I'm sorry. You okay?
-Oh, shit.

969
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:02,416
-Are you okay?
-You okay? Huh?

970
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,666
-Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
-Come on, don't cry.

971
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:07,833
-[in Hindi] I dozed off.
-[Pinky in English] Sorry.

972
00:56:07,916 --> 00:56:08,750
No problem.

973
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,875
[Hindi song playing on car radio]

974
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:12,958
[Ashok and Pinky moaning]

975
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:34,583
Pinky, stop, stop.
Stop, Pinky. We're not alone.

976
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:38,041
What? It's just Balram.

977
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:39,458
[Ashok] Yeah, but…

978
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:44,333
[Pinky] It doesn't matter, babe.
Come on. Come on, man.

979
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,333
[Ashok] You're so fucking drunk.

980
00:56:47,416 --> 00:56:50,458
[Pinky] I'm not drunk enough.
I want to go back to New York.

981
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:52,583
-Not this again.
-"Again"?

982
00:56:52,666 --> 00:56:55,500
What do you mean, "Not this again"?
You never wanna talk about it.

983
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:58,708
When we said we're coming to India,
it was supposed to be for six months.

984
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:02,791
You don't talk to me about it because
you've decided that you want to stay here.

985
00:57:02,875 --> 00:57:05,208
I'm trying to help my family.
I owe it to them.

986
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:06,833
[Pinky] Can we not talk about them?

987
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:11,583
You know, you're like a non-entity
in front of them, you know that?

988
00:57:12,916 --> 00:57:14,000
It's like…

989
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:16,250
It's like skim milk.

990
00:57:18,666 --> 00:57:20,041
Nobody likes skim milk.

991
00:57:23,916 --> 00:57:25,458
[muffled music playing on car radio]

992
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:29,291
[Ashok] We can go to a bar…

993
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:31,750
Oh, my God. Wait.

994
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:33,833
Hi, precious!

995
00:57:33,916 --> 00:57:36,125
[in Hindi] Take it, madam.
Only 100 rupees.

996
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:37,666
I'm very hungry.

997
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:38,875
Can I see?

998
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:40,583
-Ji.
-[chuckles]

999
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:43,791
Please, madam. Take three for 200.

-I'm hungry.
-Don't touch the car.

1001
